- **R**epeatable, now have repeatable procedures
- **D**efined, now you have defined procedures
- **M**anaged, you now have quantifiably managed procedures
- **O**ptimized, you are now optimizing your procedures for your business

# When you Go get a massage, make sure your Masseuse has integrity

Goguen-Meseguer security model intends to protect integrity

# Human Rights Uhsignment

Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman focuses on subject object access rights

# Clark and Wilson are Two Bouncers at a Bar

The Clark-Wilson security model describes the access control triple of Subject/Program/Object to prevent unauthorized subjects from modifying an object.  Have constrained data items (Underage Driver's Licenses), unconstrained data items (21+ driver's licenses), use an integrity verification procedure (check licenses at door), and use transformation procedures (sing happy birthday to people turning 21)

# Use Graham crackers to create delicious s'mores and then delete them securely in your mouth

Graham-Denning security model works on secure object and subject create and deletion

# Securely do the following: Create Subject, Create Object, Delete Subject, Delete Object, Read Access, Write Access, Delete Access, Transfer Access

Graham Denning has the 8 actions to securely control access. Also every time I eat s'mores I have a least 8 of them.
