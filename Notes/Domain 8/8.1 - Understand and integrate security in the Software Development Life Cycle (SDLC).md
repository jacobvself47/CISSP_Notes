# Understand and integrate security in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Core Activities essential to the development of secure systems
	- **Conceptual definition** - create the basic concept statement for a system
	- **Functional requirements determination** - determine specific system functionality
		- list the specific system requirements
			- Inputs - data provided to a function
			- Behavior - business logic describing how the system reacts to different inputs
			- Outputs - data provided from a function
	- **Control Specification development** - design security controls
	- **Design Review** - review the formal design documents to ensure functional requirements and control specifications are met
	- **Coding** - start development
	- **Code review** - look for problems in logical flow or other design/security flaws
		- done multiple times throughout the process
	- **System test Review**
		- system testing -seek out obvious errors
		- regression testing - new code performs in the same manner as the old code
		- User Acceptance Testing - users verify the code meets their requirements and formally accept for production use
	- Maintenance and change management - after production release
- Canary Testing - hyperfocused testing of a new code/features - push changes to a subset of users
- Smoke Testing - quick preliminary test after a change is made
## Development methodologies 
- **Agile** - focus on customer needs, quick, iterative development
	- Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) - application of agile at large enterprises
	- Twelve Principles of Agile
		- **Customer satisfaction** through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
		- **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development.
		- Deliver working software **frequently**, with a preference for shorter timescales.
		- **Close collaboration** between business and developers throughout the project.
		- Build projects around **motivated individuals** and trust them to get the job done.
		- **Face-to-face communication** is the most effective method of conveying information.
		- **Working software is the primary measure of progress.**
		- Agile processes promote **sustainable development**—teams should maintain a constant pace.
		- **Continuous attention to technical excellence** and good design enhances agility.
		- **Simplicity**—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
		- The best architectures, requirements, and designs **emerge from self-organizing teams**.
		- Regularly, the team reflects on how to become **more effective** and adjusts accordingly.
- **Waterfall** - sequential events, no iteration
- DevOps - single operational model that combines software development, quality assurance, and technology operations
	- reduces time to develop, test, and deploy software changes
- DevSecOps - integration of security into DevOps
	- security controls are managed by code, allowing for direct integration into the CI/CD pipeline
	- plan for security early in the development lifecycle
	- use automation
- Scaled Agile Framework
- **Spiral Method** - risk-driven development that is iterative
- **Iterative Model** - involves repeating cycles and development of small sections of the overall system
	- Each iteration builds upon the previous one, refining requirements along the way.
	- different from agile -> the entire system is planned upfront
- CleanRoom - Software with a high level of reliability and focuses on defect prevention
## Maturity models
- Capability Maturity Model (CMM)
	- SW-CMM - Software CMM - intended to improve the maturity and quality of the software processes
		- **Level 1: Initial** - little or no defined software development process
		- **Level 2: Repeatable** - basic life cycle management is implemented
			- Requirements management, project planning, tracking/Oversight, Quality Assurance, and configuration management
		- **Level 3: Defined** - formal, documented development processes
		- **Level 4: Managed** - Quantitative measures are used to gain an understanding of the development process
		- **Level 5:** Optimizing - continuous improvement
- Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) - focuses on integrating security activities into the software development and maintenance
	- **Governance** - strategy, metrics, policy, compliance, education and guidance
	- **Design** - threat modeling/assessment, security requirement/architecture
	- **Implementation** - secure build, deployment and defect management
	- **Verification** - code meets business and security requirements - through testing
	- **Operations** - maintain CIA - incident management
## Operation and maintenance
## Change management
- Manage changes to code
- Three basic process
	- Request Control - users request modifications, managers assess cost/benefit, developers prioritize tasks
	- Change Control - testing of changes to validate the address the problem/goal
	- Release Control - only approved changes go to production
- Configuration Management sits outside of change management
	- it focuses on updates to existing systems
	- ensure configuration updates follow change and configuration management procedures
## Integrated Product Team
- Integrated Product Teams - foster parallel decisions to guarantee that all aspects of the product, process, or policy are considered throughout the development process
