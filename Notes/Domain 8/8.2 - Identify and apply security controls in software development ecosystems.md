# Identify and apply security controls in software development ecosystems
## Programming languages
- machine language - long series of binary digits
	- each CPU has its own machine language
- Assembly Language - higher-level language that uses mnemonics to represent instructions of a CPU
- High-level languages need to be compiled or interpreted to run
	- compiler - converts source code into an executable file for use on a specific operating system
		- less prone to manipulation by a third-party
		- more backdoors
	- Interpreters - interpreters execute the source code stored on the system
		- less prone to backdoors
		- more people can modify
## Libraries
- Static library - library is accessed while the invoking program is being built
- dynamic/runtime library - the library is called after the program is executed
- Shared software libraries contain reusable code
	- wide usage leads to widely distributed security flaws
## Tool sets
- compilation of development tools and utilities that help development
- Software Development Kits
## Integrated Development Environment
- IDE's are used to write, test, debug, and compile code
## Runtime
- runtime environments allow the portable execution of code across different operating systems
## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
- Push code to production many times a day
- high degree of automation is required
## Software configuration management (CM)
- Software configuration management - control versions of software used throughout an org
	- Configuration Identification
	- Configuration control - changes are made in accordance with the change and configuration management policies
	- Configuration Status Accounting - Tracking of all authorized changes that take place
	- Configuration Audit - periodic audit to confirm production environment matches the accounting records

## Code repositories
- Code Repositories - central storge point for developers to store their source code
- Risks
	- access control
## Secure Programming
- SecDevOps - security from the beginning of a project to define necessary security requirements
- Inheritance - the ability of a piece of code to inherit characteristics of previous code
- Encapsulation - an object can be placed inside another object
- Polymorphism - code that can vary based on requirements - "smart-code"
- Polyinstatntiation - instantiated into multiple separate or independent instances

## Code Obfuscation
- Code Obfuscation - intentionally creates source code that is more difficult to read
	- Lexical - change the look of code - comments, debugging, format
	- Data - change the data structure
	- Control Flow - reorder statements, methods, loops, and irrelevant conditional statements
## Application security testing
- SAST - static application security testing
	- evaluates the security without running it
	- analyzes source code
- DAST - evaluates security in a runtime environment
- SCA - software composition analysis
- IAST - real-time analysis of runtime behavior, application performance, traffic, components, and backend connections
- RASP - runs on a server and intercepts calls to and from the application and validates data requests

## DBMS, concurrency, and locks
- Database Management Systems - database architecture - hardware, software, language, users, and data
- Relational Database - objects and data can be stored and linked together
- Attributes = Degree = Columns
- Tuples = Cardinality = Rows
- Key Types
	- **Candidate Key** - attributes that can be used to uniquely identify data
	- **Primary key** - one or more columns whose values uniquely identify a tuple (row)
		- Selected from the possible candidate keys
	- **Alternate Key** - Candidate keys not selected as the primary
	- **Foreign Key** - one or more columns whose values refer to the primary key in another table
- Database Security Topics
	- **Database Contamination** - mixing data with different classifications levels
		- use a trusted front-end
	- **Concurrency** - the ability for multiple processes to access or change shared data simultaneously
		- Concurrency limitations protect against:
			- Lost updates - two update processes unaware of each other
			- dirty reads - read a record that didn't fully commit
	- **Aggregation** - collect low-level security info to create high level security info
		- control aggregation function access
		- **key** - need to combine multiple data sets
	- **Inference** - deduce restricted info by analyzing patterns
		- permission controls and blurring data
		- **key** - one data set is used to infer high-level security data
	- **Polyinstantiation** -Two rows with same primary key, but different data
		- data is at two different security levels
	- **Locks** - prevent data integrity issues by preventing multiple users from updating data
- ACID - how information and transactions in a RDBMS should be treated
	- **Atomicity** - All Changes take effect or none at all
	- **Consistency** - consistent with the rules
	- **Isolation** - Transactions are invisible to other users until complete
	- **Durability** - Completed changes will not be lost
