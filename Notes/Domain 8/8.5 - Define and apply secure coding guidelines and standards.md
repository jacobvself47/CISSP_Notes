# 8.5 - Define and apply secure coding guidelines and standards
## Security weaknesses and vulnerabilities at the source-code level
- Covert channels
- Buffer overflows - information sent to a storage buffer exceeds the buffer's capacity
	- exploited to elevate privileges or launch malicious code
	- mitigate via Address Space Layout Randomization - randomize the location where system executables are loaded into memory
	- mitigate with bounds checking - variable is within bounds before use
- Memory/object reuse
- Executable mobile code
- TOCTOU - time of check to time of use
	- replacing a data file after its identity has been verified but before the data is read
- Backdoors/trapdoors
- Malformed input
- Citizen developers - self-taught, unskilled with secure coding
## Security of application programming interfaces (API)
- APIs allow for cross-site functions where websites interact with one another
- directly interact with the underlying service through function calls
- Security risks
	- authentication requirements
	- verification of authorization
- API keys are validated before processing a request to the api
- REST - Representational State Transfer
	- Newer
	- Flexible and lightweight
	- HTTP based
- SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol
	- Older
	- Rigid
	- XML
	- Strong Error Handling
## Secure coding practices
- Input Validation
- Authentication and Password Management
- Session Management
- Cryptographic Practices
- Error Handling and Logging
- System Configuration
- File/Database Security
- Memory Management
- Coupling - relatedness between units of a code base
	- low coupling - units of code can stand alone - ideal
- Cohesion - relatedness between the code that makes up a unit of code
	- high cohesion - code within a unit is highly related - ideal
- Polyinstantiation - instantiated into multiple separate or independent instances
	- prevents unauthorized inference
## Software-defined security
- Security in a computing environment that is implemented, controlled, and managed by software

## Application Attacks
- **Buffer Overflow** – An attack that exploits improper memory handling, allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
- **Time of Check to Time of Use (TOCTOU)** – A race condition attack where an attacker changes data between the time it's checked and the time it's used, leading to unintended behavior.
- **Backdoors** – Hidden entry points in software that bypass authentication, often left intentionally or inserted maliciously.
- **Privilege Escalation and Rootkits** – **Privilege escalation** exploits vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges; **rootkits** hide malicious processes to maintain control over a system.
- **SQL Injection** – Injecting malicious SQL statements into a query to manipulate a database and gain unauthorized access.
- **Blind Content-Based SQL Injection** – An attacker infers database information by sending queries and observing application responses without direct error messages.
- **Blind Timing-Based SQL Injection** – A form of SQL injection where the attacker uses time delays in database responses to extract information.
- **XML Injection** – Injecting malicious XML data to manipulate an application that processes XML, potentially leading to data leaks or unauthorized access.
- **DLL Injection** – Injecting a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) into a running process to execute arbitrary code in the context of that process.
- **Command Injection** – Injecting OS commands into an application’s input fields to execute unauthorized system commands.
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)** – A vulnerability where an attacker accesses unauthorized resources by manipulating direct object references in URLs or parameters.
- **Directory Traversal** – Manipulating file paths to access restricted directories and files on a server.
- **File Inclusion** – Exploiting an application’s ability to include files, allowing an attacker to execute malicious code (e.g., **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**, **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**).
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** – Injecting malicious scripts into web applications to execute in a victim’s browser.
- **Reflected XSS** – A type of XSS where the malicious script is embedded in a URL and executed when a victim clicks the link.
- **Stored/Persistent XSS** – A type of XSS where the malicious script is permanently stored on a website and executed when users access the affected page.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF)** – An attack that tricks a user into unknowingly executing unauthorized actions on a website where they are authenticated.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** – An attack where an application makes unintended requests to internal or external resources, often used to bypass firewalls and access internal systems.
