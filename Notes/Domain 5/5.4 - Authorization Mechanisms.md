# 5.4 - Implement and manage authorization mechanisms
## Role-based Access Control
- Access to resources is based on user roles or job functions
- users can be members of multiple groups
## Rule-based Assess Control
- Access to resources is based on a set of rules -> ACLs
- uses global rules applied to all users and subjects equally
## Mandatory Access Control
- System determines access rules based on labels
- Subject and objects have classification levels
- the MAC system makes access determination based on those classifications
- support three types of environments
	- hierarchical - grants users access using predefined labels for subjects
	- compartmentalized - ignores levels and only allows access for individual compartments on any level
	- hybrid - a combination of hierarchical and compartmentalized
- Lattice-based model
## Discretionary Access Control
- Asset owner determines who can access the asset
- Rule-based, role-based, and attribute-based are all subcategories of DAC
## Attribute-based Access Control
- Access to resources is based on user attributes
- job function, device type, time of day, asset classification
- commonly used in SDNs
## Risk-based Access Control
- grants access after a risk evaluation
- uses machine learning
##  Access policy enforcement
- Below relate to Zero Trust Access
	- **Subjects** - users, services, or systems that request access
	- **policy engines** - make policy decisions based on both rules and external systems
		- use a trust algorithm that makes the decision to grant, deny, or revoke access
		- policy decisions are logged
	- **policy administrators** - components that establish or remove the communication path between subjects and resources
	- **policy decision point** - a combination of the policy engine and policy administrator
		- Make decisions and action on decisions
	- **policy enforcement point** - forward requests from subjects and receive instructions from them about connections
