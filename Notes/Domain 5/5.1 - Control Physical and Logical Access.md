# 5.1 - Control Physical and Logical Access

## 5.1 - Control Physical and logical access to assets
- Protect organizational assets while simultaneously allowing controlled access to authorized subjects
- Access Control Principles
	- Need to know: restrict access to only required personnel who require access
	- Least Privilege: granting only the minimum permissions required by the user or system
	- Separation of Duties: requiring more than one person to complete a task - prevents fraud and errors
- Reference Monitor Concept (RMC) - a rules-based decision-making tool is placed between subjects and objects to mediate access
- Administration approaches
	- Centralized
		- one central system controls access to remote systems
		- one username and password in the central system are used to access all systems
		- Central administrative point represents a single point of failure
	- Hybrid
		- Approach taken by most organizations
		- combines centralized and decentralized methods
	- Decentralized
		- control is granted to the people closest to the resource
		- access requests are not processed by one centralized entity
		- separate usernames and passwords exist for each resource
		- lack of standardization
