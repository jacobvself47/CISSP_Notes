# 5.2 - Manage Identification and authentication of People, Devices, and Services
- Identification: assertion of a user's identity or a process to a system
- Authentication: verification of identity through knowledge, ownership, or characteristic
- Authorization: the level of access defined for the identified and authenticated user or process
- Accountability: logging and monitoring of identification, authentication, and access control
- subject - an active entity that accesses a passive object to receive information
- object -a passive entity that provides information to active subjects
- Access Control List - defines a single list of subjects for a specific object
- Access Control Matrix - defines specific access for objects and subjects
### 5.2.1 - Groups and Roles
### 5.2.2 - Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
- Identification: assertion of a user's identity or a process to a system
	- unique identifiers
	- nondescriptive of job/role
	- secure issuance
	- **Identity Proofing** - validating identity through questions
	- **Establishment of Identity** - document based (passport, driver's license)
- Authentication: verification of identity through knowledge, ownership, or characteristic
	- Authentication by knowledge - something you know
		- types: password, passphrase, or questions
		- each should be unique to the user and not easily guessed
	- Authentication by ownership - something you have
		- Types:
			- One-Time Passwords - generated via synchronous or asynchronous processes
				- time-based OTP - synchronous - more common
				- Hash-based OTP - asynchronous
			- Soft Tokens - software-based application - google authenticator
			- Hard tokens - devices that generate OTPs
			- Smartcards - card with a chip that stores, accepts, and sends information
			- Memory cards - magnetic strips that contain information
	- Authentication by characteristics - something you are
		- Crossover Error Rate (CER) - identifies the accuracy of biometric authentication
			- Represents the intersection between False Rejection (Type 1) and False Acceptance (Type 2)
			- Closer to zero means more accurate
		- Fingerprints
		- Hand geometry
		- Facial Features
		- Eyes (Retina and Iris) - retina is more accurate but slower
	- MFA - two or more of the authentication types are used
	- Kerberos is used for SSO authentication
	- SESAME - improved kerberos
		- supports symmetric and asymmetric cryptography
- Authorization: the level of access defined for the identified and authenticated user or process
- Accountability: logging and monitoring of identification, authentication, and access control
### 5.2.3 - Session Management
- management of sessions created through successful user identification, authentication and authorization
- the connection and interaction between a users and a system
- Session hijacking
	- attacker gains access to a good user's session
	- prevent by session termination, frequent/transparent re-authentication
### 5.2.4 - Registration, Proofing, and establishment of identity
- process of confirming or establishing that somebody is who they claim to be
### 5.2.5 - Federated Identity Management
- one-time authentication to gain access to multiple systems
- relies on trust relationships established between the user, identity providers, and reply party
- Standards for Federated Access
	- SAML - provides authentication and authorization
		- 1. user must authenticate via the idp
		- 2. the idp will authenticate the user through its process and issue a SAML assertion ticket
		- 3. SAML assertion ticket is provided to the user, and the user passes it to the service provider
	- OpenID - decentralized authentication
		- users login to unrelated websites with one set of credentials
		- credentials maintained by openid  provider
		- okta, auth0
	- OAuth 2.0 - authorization standard
		- internet users login via 3rd party websites
		- Microsoft, google, twitter
### 5.2.6 - Credential Management
- provide storage space for usernames and passwords
### 5.2.7 - SSO
- authenticate once on a system and access multiple resources without reauthentication
- Federated identity management (FIM) - links a user's identity in one system with multiple identity management systems
### 5.2.8 - Just in Time
- elevation of user privilges to an authorized user for a shor period, so a user may complete necessary but infrequent tasks
