# 5.6 - Implement Authentication Systems
- **OpenID** - Legacy authentication
- **Open Authorization (Oauth)** - 2.0
	- Purpose: Authorization framework that allows third-party apps to access resources without exposing user credentials
	- Context: Grants limited access to user resources - calendar app access GCal
	- key use case: delegated access
	- Managed by IETF - RFC 6749
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**
	- Purpose: authentication protocol built on Oauth2.0
		- provides authentication and authorization
	- Context: Allows users to authenticate with a third-party idp
	- key use case: SSO for web and mobile apps
	- uses JWTs that provide authentication and profile information
	- Managed by the OpenID Foundation
- **SAML**
	- Purpose: XML-based framework for exchanging authN and authZ data
	- Context: commonly used in SSO between enterprises and cloud services
	- key use case: Authenticating users once and allowing access to multiple services
- **Kerberos**
	- Purpose: Authentication
	- Uses port 88
	- uses tickets and a central key distribution center (KDC)
	- Context: secure authentication in enterprise environments - Active directory
	- key use case: mutual authentication in internal networks
	- Requires time synching with a Network Time Protocol
	- Uses AES
	- does not provide logging capabilities
	- susceptible to these attacks
		- pass-the-ticket - steal a valid kerberos ticket from memory
		- pass-the-hash - specific to NTLM - capture and reuse the NTLM hash to authN as the user
		- golden ticket - generate forged kerberos ticket that never expire
		- silver ticket - forges a Kerberos ticket for a specific service
	- Key Terms:
		- **KDC (key distribution center)** - manage authentication; issue tickets
		- **AS (Authentication Server)** - Part of the KDC that verifies identity; issues TGT
		- **TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)** - Temporary credential; used to request access to service
		- **TGS (Ticket Granting System)** - Issues service ticket based on TGT
		- **ST (Service Ticket)** - Credential that grants access to service without the need to reenter credentials
		- **Session Key** - Temporary key shared between client and service for encryption

- **Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS)**
	- **Purpose**: centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting for remote users (AAA Services)
	- Uses UDP 1812
	- Context: network access control - VPNs, WiFi
	- key use case: Enforcing access policies for remote and wireless users
	- consists of a RADIUS server and a Network Access Server
		- RADIUS Server - authentication server, provides AAA servers
		- Network Access Server - client server, centralized point to initiate connection
	- Use cases for RADIUS
		- Enterprise Wifi -> WPA2-Enterprise and WPA3-Enterprised
			- Ensures users aurhenticate wiht credentials, certificates or MFA
		- VPN Authentication -> verifies users
		- Internet Service Provider -> authenticate broadband users
		- Cloud Access Models -> Integrates with IDP for federated authentication
		- Zero Trust Access Models
- **Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)**
	- Purpose: Centralized AAA protocol, primarly for network devices
	- Context: granular control of user access to network infra
	- key use case: managing admin access to network devices
- **Authentication Factor Types**
	- Type 1 - something you know -> password
	- Type 2 - something you have -> hardware token
	- Type 3 - Something you are -> biometric
