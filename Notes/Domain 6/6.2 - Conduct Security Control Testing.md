# Conduct Security Control Testing
## Testing Overview
- Unit Testing - Individiual components of an application
	- testing can occur when the component is complete
- Interface Testing
	- Test the ways units connect and communicate to each other
	- verify components connect properly
- Integration Testing
	- testing groups of software units together
- System Testing
	- tests the whole system
## Testing Techniques
- Manual testing - person in front of a computer
- Automated testing - test scripts and batch files are automatically manipulated and executed by software
- SAST - tests underlying source code
	- white-box
- DAST - tests an application that is running
	- black-box
- Fuzzing - throwing randomness at an application to see how it responds
- Code Review
	- Peer review, formal or informal validation of code
- Runtime Testing Types
	- Positive testing - normal, expected usage to validate system operates as expected and designed under normal conditions
	- Negative testing - response of a system when normal errors are introduced
	- Misuse testing - response of a system when someone is trying to break it
- Boundary value analysisÂ - identify where there are changes in behavior. Once the boundaries have been identified, testing can be focused on either side of the boundaries, as this is where there are most likely to be bugs.
- Equivalence partitioning - identify where there are changes in behavior, then identify partitions 
	- partitions are groups of inputs that exhibit the same behavior
- Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) - inject vulnerabilities into a system to trigger security controls
## Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing
- Vulnerability Assessment
	- Use threat modeling to identify threats, then assess vulnerabilities to these threats
	- Strictly identify vulnerabilities - no exploitation of vulns
	- **Describing Vulnerabilities**
		- CVE - naming system for describing security vulns
		- CVSS - severity of security vulns
		- CCE - common Configuration Enumeration - system configuration issues
		- CPE - common platform enumeration - naming system for OS, applications, and devices
		- XCCDF - language for specifying security checklists
		- OVAL - Open Vuln and Assessment Language - describes security testing procedures
	- **Vulnerability Scans**
		- Network Discovery
			- TCP SYN Scan - single packet to each scanned port with SYN flag
			- TCP Connect Scan - opens full connection to the remote system on the port
			- TCP ACK Scan - Send packet with ACK flag - determine rules enfoced by firewall
			- UDP Scan - check for active UDP services
			- Xmas Scan - FIN, PSH, URG flags
			- NMAP - scan system and determine the current status of the port
				- Statuses
					- Open - port is open and app accepts connection on the port
					- Closed - port is open, but no app accepts connection on that port
					- Filtered - firewall filtered the connection attempt
					- Unfiltered - port accessible, cannot determine more about port
					- Open|Filtered - canot establish whether port is open or filtered
		- Network Vulnerability
			- OpenVAS is the one mentioned in the CBK
		- Web App
		- Databases
			- sqlmap
	- **Vulnerability Management Workflow**
		- Detection - initial identification of a vuln - think scanning
		- Validation - Confirm the vulnerability to determine if it is a false positive
		- Remediation - apply patches, modify device config, compensating controls
- **Penetration testing**
	- Attempts to exploit vulnerabilities
	- Stages
		- 1. Planning - rules of engagement
		- 2. Discovery
			- 2a. information gathering and scanning
				- Reconnaissance - passively gather publicly available information
				- Scanning - nmap etc
			- 2b. Vulnerability analysis - identify potential vulnerabilities to be exploited
				- Enumeration - actively enumerate through target IP address & ports
				- Fuzzing
				- Automated Scans
		- 3. Attack - manual and automated exploit tools to attempt to defeat system security
			- Exploitation - Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities
		- 4. Reporting - Identify severity and report in an appropriate format
- Testing Techniques
	- Perspective
		- Internal - inside corporate network
		- External - outside the corporate network
	- Approach
		- Blind - assessor is given little to no info about the target being testing
		- Double-Blind - assessor has little information -and- security team does not know about the test
	- Knowledge
		- black box - zero knowledge
		- gray box - given information about the target network, but not the whole set
		- white box - full knowledge (IP addresses, network diagrams)
- Vulnerability Management Process
	- understanding of all assets in an organization -> asset inventory
	- identifying the value of each asset in the inventory
	- identifying the vulnerabilities for each asset and remediation of vulnerabilities 
	- ongoing review and reassessment
## Logging
- good logs include relevant information, reviewed proactive, and scrutinized for errors/anomalies
- Log event time
	- very important that logs are synchronized
	- Network Time Protocol (NTP)
- Log file management
	- circular overwrite - overwrites entries, starting from the earliest
	- clipping levels - log events based on threshold settings
## Other Testing
- Operational Testing
	- **Real User (Passive) Monitoring** - passive monitoring of user interactions with a website or app
	- **Proactive (Synthetic) Performance Monitoring** - functionality and performance under load
- Regression Testing
	- verifies that previously tested and functional software still works after updates have been made to the code
	- performed after push-to productions
- Compliance checks
	- reviewing and analyzing implemented controls and their output to confirm alignment with documented security requirements, policies, standards, procedures, or baselines
