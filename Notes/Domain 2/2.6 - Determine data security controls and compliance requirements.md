# Determine data security controls and compliance requirements
## Data states (e.g., in use, in transit, at rest)
- **In Use**
- **In Transit**
- **At Rest**
## Scoping and tailoring
- **Baselines** provide a starting point and ensure a minimum security standard
- **Tailoring** - aligning the controls with an organization's specific security requirements
	- modifying the list of security controls within a baseline to align with the organization's mission
- **Scoping** - eliminate controls that are in the recommended baseline
	- Most often used when a baseline control does not apply to the system
## Standards selection
- Ensure compliance with external regulatory data standards
## Data protection methods
- **Digital Rights Management (DRM)** - provide copyright protection for copyrighted works
	- Prevent the unauthorized use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works
	- DRM License - grants access to a product and defines terms of use
	- Persistent Online Authentication - system must be connected to the internet for use
		- When connection or authentication fail DRM blocks the use of the product
	- Continuous Audit Trail - track all use of a copyrighted product
	- Automatic Expiration - subscription model
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** - detect and block data exfiltration attempts
	- scans unencrypted data looking for keywords and data patterns
	- Pattern-Matching - looks for specific patterns
	- **Network DLP** - scans all outgoing data in a traditional network, looking for specific data
		- Placed at network edge
	- **Endpoint DLP** - scans files stored on a system and files sent to external devices
	- **Cloud DLP** - cloud-native environments
- **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)**
	- Security policy enforcement mechanism
	- can be on-premises or in the cloud
	- solves shadow IT
- **Data masking**: hide real data by altering it into a fictional but realistic equivalent
	- protects data but allows it to be used in testing
	- **tokenization**: random string of characters used to replace other data
	- **hashing**: process of converting data into a fixed-length string using a mathematical functions
- GDPR Specific Data Protection Methods
	-  Limiting exposure to GDPR
		- **anonymization**: removing all relevant data so it is impossible to identify the original subject or person
			- if done effectively - gdpr is no longer relevant
			- only do this if you don't need the data
		- **pseudonymization**: the process of using pseudonyms to represent other data
			- mask the identity of the subject
			- results in less stringent requirements under gdpr
