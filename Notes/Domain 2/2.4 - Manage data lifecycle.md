# Manage data lifecycle
## Data roles
- **Owners** - usually a member of senior management
	- Delegate day-to-day duties
	- Cannot delegate total responsibility
- **Custodians** - usually someone in the IT department
	- Does not decide what controls are needed
	- Does implement the controls for the data owner
- **Users** - a person who accesses data to complete work tasks
- **Data Admins** - responsible for granting appropriate access to personnel - RBAC
- **business/mission owners**: responsibility overlaps with the system owner
- **asset owners**: owns assets that processes sensitive data
- GDPR Specific Terms
	-  **Processors** - process data on behalf of the data controller
	- **Controllers** - controls the processing of the data
		- Controllers collect data from subjects
	- **Subjects** - person who the data is about
## Data collection
- The easiest way to prevent the loss of data is to not collect
- if the data does not have a clear purpose for use, don't collect and store it
## Data location
- Refers to the location of data backups or copies
- Data location is a key consideration for disaster recovery
## Data maintenance
- Ongoing efforts to organize and care for data throughout its lifetime
## Data retention
- Only store data for as long as it serves a valid business process
## Data remanence
- **Data Remanence** - data that remains on media after the data was erased
- Typically refers to data on a hard drive
- Remove data remanence with a degausser
	- magnetic field, which realigns the magnetic field
	- hard drives, magnetic tapes, and floppy disks
	- Not effective on SSDs
## Data Destruction
- **Erasing** - least effective method
	- simple delete operation against a file
	- Data remains on the drive
- **Clearing** - preparing media for reuse
	- ensure that cleared data cannot be recovered with standard methods
	- process involves writing data over all addressable media locations
- **Purging** - More intense form of Clearing
	- Repeats the clearing process multiple times
	- Not valid for top-secret data
- **Degaussing** - Data removal for magnetic media
	- This could lead to damage to the media, so it is not always suitable for reuse
- **Destruction** - most secure method of sanitization
	- physically destroy the media
- **Cryptographic Erasure** - also called cryptoshredding
	- Cryptographically encrypt the data
	- Destroy the encryption keys to make data unrecoverable
- **Sanitization** - overarching idea related to data removal/destruction
	- Generally removes all media for disposal
