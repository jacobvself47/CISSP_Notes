# Secure Network components
- **Defense in depth** - combining multiple layers of security controls in a series to protect a network
- **Partitioning** - controlling the flow of traffic between segments
- **Network perimeter** - the last point that an organization can control
	- limit ingress and egress for a network to creates a choke point
	- choke point - a point where devices and technologies that enforce rules can be placed to ensure all incoming and outgoing traffic is analyzed
- Private Network segments
	- intranet - private network
	- extranet - sectioned off portion of an organization's network
		- acts as an intranet for private network
		- serves info to the internet
- **Screened Subnet** (demilitarized zone) - special purpose extranet
	- allows access for low-trust and unknown users to access specific systems
	- implemented with two firewalls or one multihomed firewall
		- One firewall between the screened subnet and the internet and one between the screened subnet and the intranet
		- Allows for access to one public system, but keeps that system from insecurely reaching internal network
	- Use Case - hosting public web servers, DNS, or mail systems
		- ![[Pasted image 20250311163107.png]]
- **Jump Box** - used for administrators to connect between isolated systems
	- live on the border between network interfaces
- **Bastion Host** - devices on the exposed internet that do not have unnecessary applications or programs
	- designed to be secured **gateways** that allow a dedicated, hardened system to control access into trusted networks from untrusted networks
	- use cases:
		- Allow authenticated external users to access internal systems
		- Providing SSH or RDP access to internal systems
- **Proxy** - an intelligent application or hardware that acts as an intermediary between clients and servers
	- usually found at Layer 7
- **Screened Host** - firewall-protected system logically positioned just inside a network
	- All inbound traffic is routed to the screened host, which acts as a proxy for the trusted systems within the private network
	- responsible for filtering traffic coming into the private network
	- Single bastion host sits between internal network and internet
	- The bastion host decides if traffic should reach internal network
	- provides application-layer filter
	- ![[Pasted image 20250311164520.png]]
- **NAT - Network Address Translation**
	- translates private IP addresses to public ones and vice versa
	- benefits: 
		- connect your network to the internet using a small amount of leased public IPv4 addresses
		- Allows for the use of private IPv4 addresses in a private network and still be able to communicate with the internet
		- Hides the IPv4 addressing scheme and network topography from the internet
		- Repels intrusion attacks
		- serves as a basic one-way firewall by only allowing incoming traffic that is in response to an internal system's request
		- Doubling NAT - two separate NAT devices (routers, firewalls, or modems) perform NAT on the same network - results in two layers of address translation
			- creates two private IP addresses
			- Cannot use double NATing with the same IP range
	- ![[Pasted image 20250311211333.png]]
- **Static NAT** - single Private IP address is mapped with a public IP address
	- one-to-one mapping between local and global addresses
- **Dynamic NAT** - A private IP address is translated into a public IP address from a pool of public IP addresses
	- Fixed number of private IP addresses can be translated to public addresses
- **PAT** - Port Address Translation (NAT Overload)
	- Many private IP addresses can be translated to a single public IP address
- **DNS** - Domain name System
	- Resolve human-friendly domain name into IP Address Equivalent
	- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** - resolves the IP address to its MAC address equivalent
	- IP Addresses are either assigned statically or dynamically via DHCP (Domain Host Configuration Protocol)
	- DNS operates over port 53
- **DNSSEC** - security extension for DNS
	- Primary function - mutual certificate (coming from a PKI) authentication and encrypted sessions between devices
- **DHCP** - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
	- Ports 67 (Server listener) and port 68 (Client listener)
	- Automatically assigns IP address to devices
	- Common use case - assign private IP address to devices on a network
	- Private IP Addresses
		- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
		- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
		- 192.168.0.0 - 192.255.255.255
	- APIPA address - self-assigned address that is used when a DHCP server is unavailable
- **Port Security** - switch port security can prohibit communications with unknown, unauthorized, or rogue devices
	- The focus of port security is protecting MAC addresses
	- **CAM Table flooding** - overwhelms the switch, causing it to broadcast traffic to all ports and potentially exposing data to attackers
		- prevent by restricting the number of MAC addresses that can be used on a single port
		- CAM Tables map MAC addresses to Ports
	- **MAC Cloning** - attempts to clone a MAC address and connect to another switch port
		- implement port security to prevent cloned MAC addresses from connecting to other ports
		- CAM tables map MAC addresses to ports
## Firewalls
- Firewall - enforces security rules between two or more networks by performing traffic filtering
- Firewall Technologies
	- Packet Filtering - examines packet headers to either block or pass packets
		- uses access control lists (ACLs) that accept or deny access
		- operates at layer 3 - can only make decisions based on the header portion of the datagram
			- source IP, destination IP, service being requested
	- Stateful Packet Filtering - State and context data are stored and updated dynamically
		- source/destination ports and IP addresses are used to track state
	- Circuit-level - creates a circuit between client and server without requiring knowledge about the service
		- No application-specific controls
		- SOCKS server - type of network proxy server
	- Application-level proxy - inspects packet payload
		- a different proxy is needed for each service
		- can be a performance bottleneck
	- Context-based access control firewall - intelligently filters TCP and UDP packets based on application layer protocol session information
		- deep traffic inspection
- Firewall Architecture
	- Dual-homed host - intelligent host that contains two network cards
	- Screened Host - uses packet filtering and dual-homed host
		- router handles the first level of decision based on any packets
		- allowed brackets can be further examined by the bastion host, which can be any type of firewall filtering
	- Screened Subnet - two firewalls deployed with a subnet (DMZ) between them
		- outside traffic can be directed to the DMZ and protect the internal network from potential attacks
	- Three-legged firewall
- Firewall Tiering relates to the number of protected zones
	- Example: Two-tiered firewall protects two network zones
## Operation of infrastructure
- redundant power
	- configure two redundant devices to provide half the power to the system, but can support 100% of the system in the event of failure
- warranty - return policy
- support 
- network equipment
	- repeaters, concentrators, and amplifiers - strengthen the communication signal
	- **multiplexer** (MUX) - digital electronic device that combines multiple input signals into a single output signal for transmission over a shared medium
	- **hubs** - connect multiple systems and network segments that use the same protocol
		- multiport repeater
		- Layer 1
	- **modems** - modulates between an analog carrier signal and digital information
		- replaced with more advanced modems
	- **Bridges** - connect two networks together, regardless of differences
		- Layer 2 
		- connect multiple LAN segments to form a larger network
		- allows devices on different segments to communicate
	- **Switches** - manage the transmission of frames via MAC addresses
		- Layer 2
		- Intelligent hub
		- knows the addresses of the systems connected on each outbound port
	- **Routers** - used to control traffic flow on networks and are often used to connect networks and control traffic flow between the two
		- static routing tables, dynamic routing tables
		- Layer 3
	- **LAN extenders** - remote access, multilayer switch used to connect distant networks over WAN links
	- **Jumpbox** - remote access system deployed to make accessing a specific or network easier or more secure
	- **Sensor** - collects information and then transmits it back to a central system for storage and analysis
## Transmission media
- physical pathways through which dat ais transmitted from one location to another
- Issues related to transmission media
	- attenuation: loss of signal strength 
	- interference: unwanted signals that disrupt the transmission
	- noise: unwanted random variations in the signal constitute noise
	- jitter: variation in latency between different packets
	- bandwidth: the range of frequencies that a medium can support
	- propagation delay/latency: the time taken for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver
- Twisted pair cable - pair of wires twisted together in a specific way to create a magnetic field
	- UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair - vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and cross-talk
	- STP - Shielded Twisted Pair - reduced electromagnetic interference
- Coaxial cable - uses voltage for communication
	- vulnerable to interference and cross-talk
- Fiber Optic - utilizes light pulses to represent 0s and 1s
	- better speed and security

## Network Access Control
- **NAC - Network Access Control** - control and restrict devices to a network based on security policies
- Goals of NAC
	- prevent/reduce known attacks directly and zero-day indirectly
	- enforce security policy throughout the network
	- use identities to perform access control
	- Enforce Authentication
	- Use Authorization
	- Compliance Enforcement
	- Device Quarantine
	- Segmentation
- Pre-Admission NAC -> Allow/deny access before connection is made
- Post-Admission NAC -> Allow/deny access after connection
- Agent-based NAC - installed on each managed system
	- compares the current configuration baseline requirements against the local system
	- can quarantine the device into a remediation subnet
	- can attempt to auto-remediate
- Agentless - performs port scans against the network-connected device
	- determines whether devices are authorized and baseline-compliant
- 802.1x - Port-based Access Control
	- Secure network authentication
	- enables users to be uniquely identified when accessing a network
	- Authorize levels of access - VLan assignment
	- Could use a radius server for authentication decisions
	- Often associated with EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)
		- EAP protects credentials transmitted over the wire

	- email screening
	- download/upload policies
	- access controls - multi-factor
	- file encryption
	- screen savers
	- local admin restrictions
	- file/server backup
