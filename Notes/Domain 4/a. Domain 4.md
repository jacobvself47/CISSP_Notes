## Notes from Questions
- In order to extend networks beyond 150 meters use
	- repeater, switch or concentrator to boost the signal
	- Use fiber cable
- VLANs are implemented via switch
	- VLANs work at layer 2 - so do switches
- IPSec provides the following security concepts
	- Encryption, message authentication, nonrepudiation, and access control
- The common issue with satellite Internet is latency
- Proxies act as intermediaries between devices and external servers to manage or filter requests
	- operate at layer 7
- SDN -> Software Defined Networks
	- Application Layer - Application Plane -> business applications
		- API requests are sent between the application and control layers to request resources
	- Control Layer -> Control Plane -> Network Services
		- handles instructions and communicates them to the network
	- Infrastructure Layer -> Data Plane
		- This is where the physical devices sit
- Port Security - switch port security can prohibit communications with unknown, unauthorized, or rogue devices
	- CAM Table flooding - overwhelms the switch, causing it to broadcast traffic to all ports and potentially exposing data to attackers
		- prevent by restricting the number of MAC addresses that can be used on a single port
		- CAM Tables map MAC addresses to Ports
	- MAC Cloning - attempts to clone a MAC address and connect to another switch port
		- implement port security to prevent cloned MAC addresses from connecting to other ports
		- CAM tables map MAC addresses to ports
- iSCSI - converged protocol that enables storage mounts over TCP
	- low cost alternative to Fibre Channel
- WPA2's encryption scheme is based on AES 
- Virtual Network - ideal for combining existing networks while maintaining transparent to users
- Site survey - detailed assessment of the wireless environment to identify coverage areas, potential access points, and security vulnerabilities
- VXLAN - encapsulation protocol that enables VLANs to traverse routable networks
	- allows two separate locations to function as if they were on the same network segment
- RFC 1918 - private addresses
	- 10.0.0.0/8, 192/168.16, 172.16/12
- APIPA address - self-assigned address that is used when a DHCP server is unavailable
- MAC addresses operate at the data link layer to identify systems on a network
- MPLS - multiprotocol label switching
	- utilized for enhancing network performance
- FCoE - Fibre Channel over Ethernet
	- enables Fibre Channel communications to occur over Ethernet networks, leveraging existing high-speed networks to transmit storage traffic
	- converged protocol
- Network modes:
	- Ad hoc mode - allows for a direct connection between two clients - 802.11ac
	- Standalone mode - connects clients through a wireless access point but does not link them to a central network
	- infrastructure mode - connects endpoints to a central network rather than directly to each other
	- wired extension mode - uses a wireless access point to connect wireless clients to a wired network
- Email security solutions
	- s/mime - supports both signed messages and a secure envelope message mode
	- dkim - domain keys identified mail
		- domain validation tool
- 5g benefits
	- improved subscriber identity protection
	- mutual authentication capabilities
- 802.1x is used for port-based authentication
	- utilizes EAP (extensible Authentication Protocol) for authentication
	- https://www.securew2.com/solutions/802-1x#documentation-link-1
- 802.11a - wireless networking
	- 802.11ac offers high-speeds
- 802.3 - ethernet
- 802.15 - Bluetooth
- PEAP - wraps EAP within a TLS a TLS tunnel
- EAP-TLS - secure but requires client certificates that complicate deployment and management
- WPA2 - most widely used
- WPA3 - most secure, but not widely adopted
- RADIUS - widely used for vpn authentication services
