# Secure Communication Channels

## Voice, video, and collaboration
- conferencing
- zoom rooms
- **SIPS - Secure Initialization Protocol for VOIP** - adds TLS to VOIP to keep session start up secure
## Remote Access
- Types of remote access
	- Tunneling - process of taking a datagram and placing it inside the data portion of another datagram 
		- also called encapsulation
		- does not provide encryption
	- Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) - a tunneling protocol that encapsulates a variety of protocols and routes them over IP networks
		- allows for traffic to be exchanged between two networks using a network like the internet
	- Split tunneling - allows a user to access disparate resources at the same time without traffic passing through the VPN
		- sensitive traffic is encrypted and routed through the VPN
		- non-sensitive or high-bandwidth traffic is sent directly to the internet
		- Security risks - direct traffic isn't encrypted, making it vulnerable to interception
	- IPSec
		- [Video Link](https://youtu.be/HDmf8ETEFLU?si=RGGMCUEn0zXunDJx)
		- preferred method for establishing a VPN
		- embedded in IPv6 as a default feature
		- encapsulating the security payload - provides confidentiality and integrity of the packet contents
		- **Authentication Header (AH)** - message integrity and non-repudiation
			- provides integrity protection for packet headers and payloads
			- Authentication
		- **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)** - confidentiality and integrity
			- provides confidentiality and integrity for packet payloads
			- Uses AES (Advance Encryption Standard)
			- Can detect and respond to session hijacking
		- **Security Associations (SA)**
			- identifies cryptographic algorithms between communicating systems
			- a best available cryptographic algorithm is selected for communication
			- Simplex communication
		- **Transport mode** - uses the header of the original datagram
			- End-User VPNs
		- **Tunnel mode** - the header of the new datagram encapsulates and encrypts the AH or ESP header and original IP header in the new datagram
			- site-to-site vpns
		- IPSec session set up
			- At runtime, use a security association
			- Two-way communication channel requires two SAs
		- Other IPSec Protocols
			- **Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)**
				- IPSec hashing algorithm
			- **IP-Payload Compression (IPCOMP)**
				- compress data prior to ESP encryption
			- **Internet Key Exchange (IKE)** 
				- Encryption, key exchange, access control, authentication, non-repudiation
				- public key cryptography
				- uses symmetric keys

- Remote Authentication
	- Protocols
		- RADIUS - support dial-in networking
			- provides authentication, authorization, and accounting
		- TACACS+ - uses TCP and encrypts all packets
		- Diameter - successor to RADIUS - better security
- Remote Access Techniques
	- **remote node operation** - remote client connects to a lan
		- connect to a remote access server
	- **service specific** - connect to a single remote service
	- **remote control** - fully control a remote system
	- **screen scraping** - automated tool interacts with the UI of a system
