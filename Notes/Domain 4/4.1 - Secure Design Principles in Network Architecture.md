- IP Address Assignment
	- Static IP Addresses
		- manually assigned to systems by an admin
		- must be unique and within the appropriate network range
	- DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
		- allows for the automatic assignment of IP addresses from an admin-configured pool
## 4.1.3 - Secure Protocols
- **IPSec** - internet protocol security
	- uses public key cryptography
	- provides encryption, integrity, access control, anti-replay, and message origin authentication
	- primary use is VPN
	- works at Layer 3
	- Also supports the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
- **Kerberos** - SSO solution
	- uses hybrid encryption
	- provides protection for logon credentials
- **SSH** - End-to-End Encryption
	- used by SFTP and VPN
- **Signal Protocol** - end-to-end encryption for voice communications, video conferencing, and text messages
- **S-RPC** - Secure Remote Procedure Call
	- authentication service for cross-network service communications
	- Prevents execution of code on remote systems
- **TLS** - Transport Layer Security
	- Layer 4: encrypts the payload of TCP communications
	- TLS uses digital certificates
	- TLS Process for encrypted sessions between two systems
		- TLS is a protocol that uses encryption and hashs
		- Client initiates connection request with Server
			- sends details on the cipher suites that the client supports and a random number
		- Server analyzes the available client cipher suites
			- identifies the best cipher suite
		- Server responds with a cipher suite, digital certificate, and a server random
		- Client verifies the digital certificate with the CAs public certificate
			- Check that the DNS name of the server is on the digital certificate
			- Certificate has not been expired or revoked
		- Client creates a session (ephemeral) key
			- Session key is generated with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm using the two random numbers
		- Symmetric encryption key is used for communication going forward
	- OpenSSL is the most common version of TLS
	- used in HTTPS

## 4.1.4 - Implications of multilayer protocols
- encapsulation of communications
- [Ethernet [ IPSec [ IP [ TCP [ TLS [ HTTP [ Payload] ] ] ] ] ] ]
- Can be used to hide or isolate an unauthorized protocol inside another authorized one
- unbound encapsulation supports the ability to jump between vLANs
- Benefits of multilayer protocol
	- wide range of protocols can be used at higher layers
	- encryption can be incorporated at various layers
	- flexibility in complex network structures
- Drawbacks of multilayer protocol
	- covert channels are allowed
	- filters can be bypassed
	- logically imposed network segment boundaries can be overstepped
## 4.1.5 - Converged protocols
- merging of specialty or proprietary protocols with standard protocols
- benefit: use existing TCP/IP supporting network infrastructure to host special services
- SAN - Storage Area Network
	- A secondary network is used to consolidate storage devices into a single network-accessible storage container
	- encapsulate or converge data storage signals into TCP/IP communications to separate storage and proximity
- iSCSI - Internet Small Computer Systems Interface
	- enables location-independent file storage, transmission, and retrieval over LAN, WAN, or public internet
	- standard based on IP that operates at Layer 5
- IBoE - InfiniBand over Ethernet
	- encapsulation of InfiniBand traffic within Ethernet frames
	- InfiniBand is a high-performance and low-latency technology used in High-performance computing environments
- CXL - Compute Express Link
	- used in AI, ML, High-Performance Computing
	- supports communication of CPUs, GPUs, accelerators, memory over a single high-speed interconnect
- VOiP - Voice Over IP
	- tunneling mechanism that encapsulates audio and video into IP packets to support voice and video calls
	- combines audio/video encapsulation at layer 7 with the established protocol stack of TCP/IP
	- **Security Considerations**
		- Attacks:
			- Phishing/Vishing
			- SPIT (spam over internet telephony)
			- MiTM - spoof the call manager or endpoint connection
			- Eavesdropping - VOIP is internet traffic that can be listened in on
			- Attacks on the host OS like DoS
			- VLAN and VOIP hopping - VoIP phones on the same switches as desktop and server systems
				- 802.1X authentication falsification
		- Protection:
			- SIP - Session Initiation Protocol - establishes the communication link between endpoints
			- SRTP - Secure Real Time Transport Protocol - provides encryption and authentication
		- Secure VOIP systems would be on segregated VLANs, have SIP and SRTP enabled
- MPLS - Multi-protocol label switching
	- Speed up network traffic by using labels instead of traditional routing
## 4.1.6 - Transport architecture
- **network topology**
	- BUS - each system is connected to a trunk cable
		- All systems can transmit at the same time
		- Will result in collisions
		- Ethernet
		- ![[Pasted image 20250224160014.png]]
	- STAR - central hub
		- each system connects back to the hub
		- single point of failure
		- ![[Pasted image 20250224160032.png]]
	- MESH - Connects systems to all other systems
		- Redundant connects allow for more uptime
		- ![[Pasted image 20250224160046.png]]
	- RING - Unidirectional Loop
		- 1 system at a time can transmit data
		- Token-ring when a token is used
		- collision avoidance
		- ![[Pasted image 20250224160059.png]]
	
	- Analog communications - continuous signal that varies in frequency, amplitude, phase, voltage, etc
		- The variance in the signal produce a wave shape
		- Tends to become corrupted over long distances
			- Attenuation -> reduction in signal
	- Digital communications - Discontinuous electrical signal and a state change or on/off pulses
		- More reliable over long distances
		- uses current voltage
	- Synchronous - comms rely on a timing or clock mechanism
		- support high rates of data transfer
		- Used in networking
	- Asynchronous - rely on stop and start delimiters to manage the transmission of data
		- best for small amounts of data transfer
	- Baseband - support only a single communication channel
		- digital signal
		- uses direct current applied to the cable to form binary signals
			- high current = 1 - low current = 0
	- Broadband: multiple simultaneous signals
		- Analog signal
		- uses frequency modulation to support channels
		- each channel supports a distinct communication mechanism
		- TV, Cable Modem
	- Broadcast - supports communications to all possible recipients
	- Multicast - supports comms to multiple specific recipients
	- Unicast - supports a single communication to a specific recipient
- Dealing with network collisions
	- **Collision Domain** - systems that could cause a collision if they broadcast at the same time
	- **Broadcast Domain** - systems that can receive a broadcast from each other
	- **CSMA** - Carrier Sense Multiple Access
		- decreases collisions when 2 or more stations send signals over the data link layer
		- Each station checks the state of the medium before sending
		- Reduces the chances of collisions but does not directly address it
	- **CSMA/CD** - Collision Detection
		- Responds to collisions by forcing short but random wait time before reprocessing
		- Used by ethernet
		- 802.3 standard
	- **CSMA/CA** - Collision Avoidance
		- grants a single permission to communicate at any give time
		- used by ring-token networks, wireless technologies
		- 802.11
	- **Token Passing** - communications using a digital token
		- pass a token to the next systems
		- prevents collisions in a ring network
	- **Polling** - communications via master/slave configuration
		- primary polls, each secondary to see if it needs to transmit data
- **Planes**
	- division of networking functionality and responsibilities into distinct layers or planes, each serving a different purpose
	- data plane - responsible for the transmission of user data between network devices
		- performs packet forwarding, switching and routing
	- control plane - manages and maintains forwarding tables used by the data plane
		- handles routing protocols and decision-making on data forwarding
	- management plane - overall network device administration
- **Types of Switches**:
	- cut-through switching - forward a frame as soon as it reads the destination address
		- low latency
	- store-and-forward switching - receives the entire frame in a buffer before forwarding
		- better for ensuring data integrity
- **Network Gateways**
	- purpose - translate data between different protocols
	- enables communication between disparate networks
	- BGP - Border Gateway Protocol
		- use tables at the network border to properly route traffic to external sites
## 4.1.7 - Performance metrics
- **bandwidth** - the network capacity available to carry communication
- **latency** - the time it takes a packet to travel from source to destination
- **jitter** - The variation in latency between different packets
- **packet loss** - packets lost between source and destination
- **interference** - electrical noise, fault equipment, and other factors that might corrupt the contents of packets
- **throughput** - The actual amount of data transmitted successfully over a network over a given time period
	- measures the effectiveness of data transfer
- **signal-to-noise ratio** - A measure of the quality of signal in a communication channel
	- higher SNR = better quality
## 4.1.8 - Traffic Flows
- **East-West Traffic** - traffic flow that occurs within a specific network, data center, or cloud environment
- **North-South Traffic** - traffic flow that occurs inbound or outbound between internal and external systems
- southbound interface: path from the SDN controller to the network devices in the data plane
- northbound interface: path from the SDN controller to the applications or services in layer 7
## 4.1.9, 4.1.10, 4.1.11 - Segmentation
- The use of smaller units, groupings, segments, or subnetwork to improve the following:
	- Boost Network Performance by placing systems that often communicate together in the same segment
	- Reducing Communication Problems
	- Providing Security by isolating traffic and user access to those segments
- Subnet Notation
	- Subnet Mask Notation
		- IP Adress: 192.18.1.100
		- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
	- Slash Notation
		- 192.168.1.0/24
			- 24 represents the of binary 1s in the address
			- Binary 1s are locked, so the remaining bits are available for the subnet
### 4.1.9 - Physical Segmentation
- in-band - use of the same communication path or infrastructure for both data and control traffic
- out-of-band - separating data and controlling traffic onto different communication paths
- air-gapped - most stringent form of physical segmentation
	- complete physical separation of two systems/networks
	- no physical connection
### 4.1.10 - Logical segmentation 
- **VLANs** - logically divides a physical LAN into multiple isolated broadcast domains
	- devices on VLAN can communicate with each other normally
	- improves network performance, security, and flexibility
	- used by enterprises to segregate traffic based on department or security level
	- **example: VLANs for Accounting, Sales, and IT**
	- Layer 2 - operates on data frames
	- Configuring a VLAN
		- Enable VLAN Trunking - allow switches in different network locations to carry the same VLAN
		- Assign switchports to the VLANs 
	- [Video Link](https://youtu.be/jC6MJTh9fRE?si=WJxOuP3XP5YMu9OW)
- **VPNs** - secure and encrypted communication channels over an untrusted public network
	- allow remote users to securely connect to the main corporate network
	- VPN Modes
		- **Transport Mode** - encryption protection for just the payload
			- The IP header is unencrypted
			- Best used in trusted networks and individual networks
			- BPNs are anchored to the individual host
		- **Tunnel Mode** - Encrypts the IP Header and Payload
			- Adds header to the original packet
			- Used for site-to-site VPNs
				- Remote Access VPN (aka link encryption VPN)
				- Only encrypts the VPN link
				- Other data in other network segments might not be encrypted
	- Types of VPNs
		- Site-to-Site VPNs - connect remote offices to each other and headquarters
		- Remote Access VPNs - provide remote access to corporate networks for mobile users
	- VPNs create an encrypted tunnel connecting different networks
		- traffic is encrypted entering the tunnel
		- traffic is decrypted exiting the tunnel
	- VPN Endpoints - required for VPNs to work - these enpoints must be on the remote network to allow for VPN communication
		- firewalls
		- routers
		- servers
		- VPN concentrator - preferred in high-volume situations
	- VPN Protocol Overview
		- **L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)** - UDP 1701
		- **SSH (Secure Shell)** - TCP 22
			- All ssh transmissions are encrypted (authentication information and data)
			- limited to transport mode
		- **OpenVPN** - based on TLS
			- supported by most WAP (Wireless Access Points)
		-  **IPSec** is used to create Layer 3 VPNs - most often used for static site-to-site VPNs
			- links between internal and external hosts/networks
	- SSL/TLS VPNs are more widely used for remote access VPNs
		- port 443
	- Remote Access VPN Approaches
		- **Full Tunnel VPN**
			- All network traffic leaving the connected device is routed through the VPN, regardless of destination
		- **Split Tunnel VPN**
			- Only traffic destined for the corporate network is sent through the VPN tunnel
			- Other traffic is routed directly over the internet
			- not recommended as it provides a false sense of security
		- **Always On VPN**
			- All corporate mobile devices automatically connect to the VPN when it is turned on
- **Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)** - multiple instances of a routing table to exist on a router
	- each VRF operates as a separate routing domain, enabling the isolation of routing information
