## Backup storage strategies (e.g., cloud storage, onsite, offsite)
- Archive Bit - metadata that indicates the status of a backup relative to a give backup strategy
	- 0 = no changes to the file - no backup required
	- 1 = file has been modified - backup required
- Full backups - complete copy of the data contained on the device
- Incremental Backup - changes since the last incremental backup (or full backup depending on schedule)
	- uses the least storage
	- in a DR event, required to restore more databases
- Differential Backup - store all changes since the last full backup
	- does not change the archival bit
- Mirror Backup - exact copy of a data set is created, with no compression
	- fastest to backup and restore, but uses the most storage
- Offsite storage
- Electronic Vaulting - automated tape management system
- Tape Rotation - using different types of tape
- Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) - used to validate integrity of backup data
## Recovery site strategies (e.g., cold vs. hot, resource capacity agreements)
- cold site - standby facilities with electrical and support systems but no computing
	- inexpensive, but high RTO
- warm site - basic shell of the building and basic equipment is installed
- hot site - facility that is in constant working order
	- data is replicated to the hotsite
- mirror site
## Multiple processing sites
- **Remote Mirroring** - maintains a live database server at the backup site and mirrors all transactions between the sites
- **Remote Journaling** - transfer transaction logs to a remote site on an hourly basis
- **Electronic Vaulting** - transfer database backups from the prioary database to a remote site on a scheduled basis - daily
## System resilience, high availability (HA), Quality of Service (QoS), and fault tolerance
- **RAID** - Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks
	- RAID 0 - striping -> No fault tolerance
	- RAID 1 - Mirroring -> 2 disks with same data
		- fault tolerance
	- Raid 5 - Striping with Parity -> 3 or more disks
	- Raid 6 -> 4 disks
		- protects against the failure of 2 disks
	- Raid 10 - Stripe of Mirrors -> 2 or more mirrors (raid 1)
		- if both disks in mirror fail whole system fails
		- fault tolerance for 1 disk in each array
