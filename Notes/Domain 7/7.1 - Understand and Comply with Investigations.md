# Understand and Comply with Investigations
## Evidence collection and handling
- Forensic Investigation Process
	- Identification and securing of a crime scene
	- Proper collection of evidence that preserves its integrity and the chain of custody
	- Examination of all evidence
	- Further analysis of the most compelling evidence
	- Final Reporting
- Sources of information and evidence
	- Oral/Written Statements
		- Given to authorities
	- Written Documents
		- relevant documents to the investigation
	- Computer Systems
	- Visual/audio
- Types of Evidence
	- real (object) evidence
		- actual objects related to the case (hard drives, laptops, keyboards)
	- documentary evidence
		- written evidence used to prove a fact
	- testimonial evidence
		- testimony of a witness
	- demonstrative evidence
		- supports testimonial evidence
- Locard's exchange principle
	- when a crime is committed something is taken and something is left behind
- Five Rules of Evidence
	- Authentic - evidence is not fabricated
	- Accurate - evidence has not been changed or modified
	- Complete - all pieces of evidence must be available and shared regardless of whether or not it supports the case
	- Convincing/Reliable - easy to understand and must be true
	- Admissible - accepted as part of the case
		- Relevancy - evidence is relevant to determining a fact
		- Materiality - The fact must be related to the case
		- Competency - Evidence must be legally obtained
- eDiscovery Reference Model - standard process for conducting eDiscovery
	- Information governance - information is well organized
	- Preservation - protected against alteration or deletion
	- Collection - gather relevant information
	- Processing - goal is to reduce the amount of info requiring detailed screening
	- Review - determine relevant information
	- Analysis - deeper inspection of the content and context of information
	- Production - format info for sharing
	- Presentation - display info to other parties
- Chain of Custody
	- control evidence to maintain integrity
	- who collected and handled what evidence, when and where
- Companies have an obligation to preserve evidence when they believe that the threat of litigation is imminent
## Reporting and documentation
## Investigative techniques
- media analysis - examines the bits on a hard drive that may no longer have pointers, but the data is still there
- software analysis - focuses on the application
- malware analysis - determine how the malware works and what it is trying to do
## Digital forensics tools, tactics, and procedures
- **5 principles for forensic analysis**
	- Upon seizing digital evidence, make sure the evidence is not changed
	- Only "forensically competent" people should access the original digital evidence
	- Fully document all activity related to the seizure, access, storage, or transfer of digital evidence
	- The individual is responsible for all actions taken with respect to digital evidence while it is in their possession
	- Any agency involved with the digital evidence is responsible for compliance with these principles
- Best to work with a copy of the evidence to preserve integrity
- **Media Analysis** - identification and extraction from storage media
	- Use a Write Blocker to physically sever the portion of the cable used to connect the storage device that would write data
	- Calculate a cryptographic hash of the original device contents, create a new image, and recalculate the hash to ensure integrity/authenticity - this new image is called a forensic image
- **In-Memory Analysis** - use tools to generate a memory dump file
	- cryptographic hash calculations to ensure integrity/authenticity
- **Network Analysis** - difficult to do if network data isn't deliberately recorded in real-time
	- Relies on the knowledge that an incident is underway or pre-existing security controls that log network activity
	- Network activity logging methods
		- IDS and IPS logs
		- Network flow monitoring systems
		- packet captures collected during an incident
		- Network security device logs (firewall)
	- During a live analysis (attack in-progress) use a SPAN port on a switch or a network tap
		- Both of these methods mirror data for analysis
- **Software Analysis** - forensic review of applications or activity on a running application
- **Hardware/Embedded Device Analysis**
- 
## Artifacts (e.g., data, computer, network, mobile device)
- remnants of a breach of a system or network
- Computer systems, web browsers, mobile devices, hard drives, flash drives
