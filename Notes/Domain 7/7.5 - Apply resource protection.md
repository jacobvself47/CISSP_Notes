# Apply resource protection
## Media management
- Media includes tapes, CDs, DVDs, USB drivers, hard drives, cell phones
- Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) - how many times media can be reused
	- destroy media once MTTF has been reached
- Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) - time expected between failures that will require repair
## Media protection techniques
- Sensitive media should be stored in a secure location with strict access controls
- temperature and humidity controls should be in place
- Restrictions on access to device media drives
