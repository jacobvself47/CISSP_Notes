# Implement Disaster Recovery (DR) processes
## BCM, BCP, DRP
- BCM - process by which an organization is responsible for creating, maintaining, and testing BCP and DRP plans
- BCP - focuses on the survival of the business process when something unexpected impacts it
- DRP - focuses on the recovery of vital technology infrastructure and systems
- Key steps in the BCP/DRP
	- Develop contingency planning policy
	- Conduct BIA
	- Identify Controls
	- Create Contingency Strategies
	- Develop Contingency Plan
	- Ensure testing, training, and excercises
	- Maintenance
## RPO, RTO, WRT, and MTD
- Four key measurements of time for BC/DR
	- RPO - max tolerable data loss measured in time
	- RTO - max tolerable time to recover systems to a defined service level
	- WRT - work recovery time
		- max tolerable time to verify system and data integrity
	- MTD - maximum tolerable downtime
		- max amount of time a system can be disrupted before unacceptable consequences occur
## Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- BIA predicts the consequences of a disruption to business process to develop recovery strategies for each critical function or process
- BIA Process
	- identify priorities - the most critical business functions, process, or systems
		- max downtime/outage, recovery time, recovery objective, work recovery time
	- identify risks (vulnerabilities and threats) to the organization's business continuity
	- identify likelihood of risks
	- identify impact of risks
	- consider countermeasures
	- prioritize resources
- BIA Steps
	- Determine mission-critical processes
	- Identify resource requirements
	- Identify recovery priorities
## Disaster Response Process
- Declare a disaster when the Maximum Tolerable Downtime is going to be exceeded
- Initiate response process if the MTD is going to be exceeded
