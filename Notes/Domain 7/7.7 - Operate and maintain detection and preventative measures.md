# Operate and maintain detection and preventative measures
- Preventative Control - attempts to thwart or stop unwanted activity
- Detection Control - attempts to discover or detect malicious activity

## Firewalls (e.g., next generation, web application, network)
- WAF - Web Application Firewalls
	- Protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a web app and the internet
	- Protect against attacks like XSS, CSRF, and SQL Injection
	- Some will come with OWASP top 10 protections.
- NGFW - Next Generation 
	- a deep-packet inspection firewall that goes beyond port/protocol inspection
	- adds application-level inspection and intrusion prevention and brings in intelligence feeds from outside the firewall
## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
- Detect and prevent attacks
- IDS - Intrusion Detection System
	- actively watches for suspicious activity by monitoring network traffic and inspecting logs
	- Knowledge (Signature) -Based Detection
		- uses a database of known attacks developed by the IDS vendor
		- lower false-positive rate
		- only effective against known attack methods
	- Behavior-Based Detection
		- creates baseline of normal activities and then detect abnormal activity
		- raises more false positives
	- Network-Based IDS (NIDS)
		- monitors a network by observing network traffic patterns
	- Host-Based IDS (HIDS)
		- monitors activity on a single computer
- IPS - Intrusion Prevention System
	- detect and block attacks
	- Network-Based IDS (NIPS)
		- must be placed inline with the traffic to block attacks
- In-line IDPS acts as an IPS and would block malicious traffic in real-time
## Whitelisting/blacklisting
- Whitelist - Allow
- Blacklist - Deny
## Third-party provided security services
## Sandboxing
- Sandboxing is a virtualization technique that provides a security boundary for applications and prevents the application from interacting with other applications
## Honeypots/honeynets
- Honeypots - Trap or decoy for intruders or insider threats
- Honeynets - two or more networked honeypots used together to simulate a network
- The goal is to grab the attacker's attention and keep them away from the legitimate network
- You can only entice attackers and not entrap them
## Anti-malware
- Anti-malware protects against malicious code from being executed
- signature-based anti-malware
	- used file signatures to block files
	- does not protect against zero-day malware
- Heuristic systems
	- look at the underlying code or behavior of a file
		- Static analysis
		- Dynamic - run in a sandbox
## Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based tools
- The role of AI & ML
	- reduce the risk of breach and improve security posture efficiently and effectively
- Enables investigation at scale
- Can help create baselines for users, assets, and networks that allow for the detection of deviations from the baseline


## Types of Malware
| Malware Type         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Virus                | The defining characteristic of a virus is it's a piece of malware that has to be **triggered in some way by the user.**                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Worm                 | A worm is a piece of malware that can **self-propagate** and spread through a network or a series of systems on its own by **exploiting a vulnerability** in those systems                                                                                                                                   |
| Companion            | Companion malware is **helper software**. It's not malicious on its own; rather, it could be something like a wrapper that accompanies the actual malware.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Macro                | A macro is something often found in Microsoft Office products, like Excel, and is created using a straightforward programming language to automate tasks. Because a programming language is involved, macros can be programmed to be malicious and harmful.                                                  |
| Multipartite         | Multipartite means the malware **spreads in different ways**. Stuxnet is a perfect example of multipartite malware.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Polymorphic          | Every time it replicates across a network, polymorphic malware **can change aspects of itself**, like file name, file size, code structure, and so on, to **evade detection**.                                                                                                                               |
| Trojan               | A Trojan horse is malware that **looks harmless** or desirable but **contains malicious code**. Trojans are often found in software that is easily and freely downloadable from the internet.                                                                                                                |
| Botnet               | A botnet is **many infected systems that have been harnessed together and act in unison**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Boot sector infector | Boot sector infectors are pieces of malware that can **install themselves in the boot sector of a hard drive**.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Hoaxes/pranks        | Hoaxes and pranks are not actually software. Instead, they're typically **social engineering**—via email or other means—that intends harm (hoaxes) or just a good laugh (pranks).                                                                                                                            |
| Logic bomb           | A logic bomb is a bit of code that will execute **based on some logic**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Stealth              | Stealth malware is malware that uses various **active techniques to avoid detection**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Ransomware           | Ransomware is gaining in popularity very rapidly. It is a type of malware that typically **encrypts a system or a network of systems**, effectively locking users out, and **then demands a ransom payment** (usually in the form of a digital currency, like Bitcoin) to gain access to the decryption key. |
| Rootkit              | Similar to stealth malware, rootkit malware attempts to mask its presence on a system. As the name implies, a rootkit typically includes a collection of malware tools that an attacker can utilize according to specific goals.                                                                             |
| Data diddler         | A data diddler is a piece of malware that **makes minimal changes over a long period** to evade detection.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Zero-day             | A zero-day is **any type of malware that's never been seen in the wild before**. The vendor of the impacted product is unaware, as are security companies that create anti-malware software intended to protect systems.                                                                                     |
| Crypto malware       | malicious software that uses stolen computing power for financial gain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
