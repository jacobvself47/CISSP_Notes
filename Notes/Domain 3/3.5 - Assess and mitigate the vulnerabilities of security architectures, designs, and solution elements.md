# Assess and mitigate the vulnerabilities of security architectures, designs, and solution elements
- **Execution Types**
	- **Multitasking** - handling two or more tasks simultaneously 
	- **Multicore** - independent execution cores of a CPUs
	- **Multiprocessing** - Using one processor to complete the execution of a multithreaded application
	- **Multiprogramming** - execution of two tasks on a single processor - coordinated by the OS - batches multiple processes
	- **Multithreading** - multiple concurrent tasks performed within a single process
- **Protection Rings**
	- **ring 0** - innermost circle
		- OS Kernel/Memory
	- **ring 1** - second circle from inside
		- Other OS components
	- **ring 2** - third circle from inside
		- Drivers, Protocols, etc.
	- **ring 3** - fourth circle from inside
		- User-level programs
## Client-based systems
- Client-based vulnerabilities place the user, their data, and their system at risk
- Client is the target
- local caches are a risk with client-side attacks
	- **Cache Poisoning** - insert malicious files into cache
		- calls to the malicious cache item result in code execution
		- frequently associated with web-based forums
	- **Split Response** - attacker manipulates HTTP responses
		- Inject malicious content into subsequent responses
	- **DOM XSS** - javascript is injected into the DOM
- **protections**
	- keep browser updated (client side)
	- implement secure javascript libraries (server side)
	- Use a content security policy (CSP) that enforces same-origin restrictions for browser side technologies
## Server-based systems
- **data flow control** - control the flow of data between processes, devices, over a network, or other communication channels
	- load balncers distribute network traffic load across network links or devices
		- help maintain optimnal infrastructure utilization, minimize response time, maximize throughput, reduce overloadeing, eliminate bottlenecks
## Database systems
## Cryptographic systems
## Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
- Used in industrial industries
- **programmable logic controllers (PLCs)** - single-purpose digital computers
	- manage and automate industrial operations
- **distributed control systems (DCSs)** - gather data and implement control over a large-scale environment from a single location
	- controlling elements are distributed across environment and monitored centrally
- **supervisory control and data acquisitions (SCADA)** - monitor and control a wide range of industrial processes
## Cloud-based systems (e.g., Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS))
- **IaaS (Infrastructure):**
	- CSP provides building blocks
	- CSP manages staff, hardware, and data center
	- examples: Azure VMs, AWS Ec2
- **PaaS (Platform):**
	- The customer is responsible for the deployment and management of the applications
	- CSP manages provisioning, configuration, hardware, and operating system
	- examples: Azure SQL Database
- **Serverless (FaaS) vs. PaaS**
	- serverless - the CSP has more responsibility
	- The customer designs the application's logic and triggers
- **SaaS (Software):**
	- Customer configures features
	- CSP is responsible for management, operations, and availability
## Distributed systems
- **distributed system - distributed computing environment (DCE)**
	- collection of individual systems that work together to support a resource or provide a common service
- DCE typically includes an **interface definition language (IDL)**
	- define the interface between. client and server processes in the DCE
	- Related IDL frameworks
		- RPC - remote procedure calls
		- CORBA - commmon object request broker architecture
		- DCOM - distributed component object model
- **Security Issues** - the interconnectedness of components leads to malware propagation
	- large attack surface
## Internet of Things (IoT)
- IoT devices provide automation, remote control, or processing to appliances or devices
- operate similar to an embedded system in that they are part of a larger system (smart fridge)
- **Security Issues** - access and encryption
	- traverse network connected to an IoT device
## Microservices (e.g., application programming interface (API))
- **Service-oriented architecture (SOA)** - new applications or functions created out of existing but separate software services
	- results in a new application that has unknown security issues
- **Microservices** - application is a collection of small, independently deployable services
	- each microservice has specific business capability and operates as a self-contained unit
	- scalable, maintainable, independently deployable
	- Each microservice exposes an API that allows communication and interaction with other services within the architecture
- **Security Issues** - distributed and interconnected nature leads to security concerns
	- Authentication and Authorization
	- Data encryption
	- API security
	- monitoring and logging
	- container security
## Containerization
- Self-contained environments that package applications and dependencies
- **Containers** - lightweight, portable OS-level virtualization
- Requires orchestration layer
- Docker, kubernetes, etc
## Serverless
- Cloud computing model where code runs in ephemeral containers without managing servers
- Execution of code in short-lived, event-driven functions (AWS Lambda)
- Stateless and run when triggered
## Embedded systems
- **Embedded System** - computing component added to an existing mechanical or electrical system for the purpose of providing automation, remote control, or monitoring
- Typically designed around a limited set of specific functions that relate to the larger product
- **Security Issues** - static systems, that don't offer access to address security vulnerabilities
	- lack of security and difficulty with upgrades/patches
## High-Performance Computing systems
- **HPC** - computing platform designed to perform complex calculations or data manipulations
- **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)** - process data as it arrives on the system with minimal latency
	- RTOS is stored on read-only memory (ROM)
	- **Security Issues** - narrow focus of the system leaves little room for security
		- proprietary code - bugs or flaws
## Edge computing systems
- **Edge computing** - data and compute resources are located as close as possible to optimize bandwidth and minimize latency
	- Each device can process its own data locally
	- Example: static web pages located nearer the visitor
- **Fog Computing** - collect data, then transfer it back to a central location for processing
	- fog computing processing is positioned in the LAN
	- example: sensors and IoT devices
## Virtualized systems
- Software layer that allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical servers
- **Type 1 Hypervisor** - bare-metal hypervisor
	- no host OS - hypervisor installed directly onto the hardware
	- support server virutalization
	- good for cost reduction and eliminating OS security risks
- **Type 2 Hypervisor** - hosted hypervisor
	- OS is present on the hardware
	- hypervisor is installed as another software application
	- typical with desktop deployments
- Benefits of virtualization
	- small deployment footprint
	- scalability
- **Elasticity** - the flexibility to expand or contract resource utilization based on needs
	- dynamically scale resources based on real-time usage
-  **Scalability** - create more resources based on a long-term plan
- **Virtualized Networks** - combination of hardware and software networking components into a single entity
	- Software control over management, traffic shaping, address assignment
- **Software Defined Everything**
	- **VDI** - hosting of desktop OS on central server
	- **Thin Client** - virtual interface to remotely access a mainframe or VM
	- **Software-defined visibility** - network monitoring and response
	- **Virtual Data Center** - cloud service
- VM Escaping - software within a guest OS is able to breach the isolation-protection of the hypervisor to enter into another guest OS or the Host OS
