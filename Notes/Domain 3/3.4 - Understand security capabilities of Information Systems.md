# Understand security capabilities of Information Systems (IS)
## Memory Protection
- prevent an active process from interacting with an area of memory that was not specifically assigned or allocated to it
- Key Concepts related to Memory Protection
	- **Process Isolation** - each process runs in its own memory space
		- prevents one process from interfering with another
	- **Virtual Memory** - Maps physical memory to logical addresses
		- Allows efficient memory management and isolation
	- **Memory Segmentation** - divides memory into different segments (code, stack, heap)
		- protects different types of memory from unauthorized access
	- **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)** - Randomizes memory addresses of system files and applications
		- Mitigates buffer overflow and memory corruption attacks
	- **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)** - Prevents execution of code in non-executable memory areas
		- Stops buffer overflow and malware from executing in writable memory
- Types of Memory Vulnerabilities and Attacks
	- **Buffer Overflow** - writing more data than allocated for a memory buffer
		- leads to code execution, system crashes
	- **Heap Overflow** - overflowing dynamically allocated memory
		- overwrite function pointer and exploit execution flow
	- **Use-After-Free** - Accessing memory after it has been freed
		- Arbitrary code execution
	- **Return-Oriented Programming** - chaining together return instructions to execute malicious code
		- Bypasses DEP and allows for arbitrary code execution
	- **Memory Leak** - failing to release memory, leading to exhaustion
		- slows down or crashes a system
## Trusted Platform Module
- **Trusted Platform Module** - cryptoprocessor chip
	- physical chip used to implement cryptography-based security
	- commonly used for device authentication, disk encryption, and secure boot processes.
	- example: BitLocker drive encryption on a Windows device
- **Hardware Security Module** - cryptoprocessor used to manage and store digital encryption keys, accelerate crypto operations, support faster digital signatures, and improve authentication.
	- TPMs are one type of HSM
## Encryption/Decryption
