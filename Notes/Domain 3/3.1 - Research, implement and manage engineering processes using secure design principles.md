# Research, implement and manage engineering processes using secure design principles
## Threat modeling
- security process where potential threats are identified, categorized and analyzed
- either proactive or reactive
- Identify potential harm, the likelihood of occurrence, the prior concern, and the means to eradicate or reduce the risk
- See 1.10
## Least privilege
- subjects are granted only the privileges necessary to perform assigned work tasks and no more
## Defense in depth
- **Defense in depth** - aka layering
- use of multiple controls in a series
- Layering should be don in a series rather than in parallel
## Secure defaults
- Systems are designed with the most secure settings enabled by default
## Fail securely
- **Fail-Secure** - system remains protected when it fails
	- default to a secure state
- **Fail-soft** - allow a system to continue to operate after a system failure
- **Fail-Safe** - revert to a state that protects the health and safety of people
- **Fail-Open** - Same as Fail-Safe
- **Fail-Closed** - Same as Fail-Secure
## Segregation of Duties (SoD)
- No single person has total control over a critical function or system
- Prevents a single person from compromising a system
- **Two-Person Control**
	- require the approval of two individuals for critical tasks
	- ensures peer review
	- reduces the likelihood of collusion and fraud
## Keep it simple and small
- avoid overcomplicating the environment
- complex systems are more difficult to secure - increased attack surface
- Related Concepts
	- Dont Repeat Yourself (DRY) - eliminate redundancy
	- Computing Minimalism - code that uses the least necessary hardware and software resources
	- Rule of least power - least powerful programming language
	- Worse is Better (New Jersey Style) - software quality does not increase with increase capabilities
	- You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI) - don't write functions that aren't needed
## Zero trust or trust but verify
- Nothing and no person inside the organization is automatically trusted
- Each request for activity or access is assumed to be from an unknown and untrusted location until verified
- All access requests are authenticated, authorized, and encrypted prior to being granted access
- 
## Privacy by design
- **7 principles of privacy by Design**
	- Proactive, not reactive, preventative, not remedial
	- Privacy as the default setting
	- privacy embedded into design
	- full functionality - positive sum
	- end-to-end security - full lifecycle protection
	- visibility and transparency
	- respect for user privacy - user-centric
## Shared responsibility
- organizations do not operate in isolation
- organizations are integrated with the rest of the world and share the responsibility of establishing and maintaining security
## Secure access service edge (SASE)
- Cloud-based security framework that combines networking and security services into a single solution
- Combination of SD-WAN and cloud security tools that provide secure, fast access to resources from anywhere
- User or device connects to the nearest SASE cloud point of presence (PoP) instead of the corporate network
- Traffic is inspected in the cloud -> ZTNA, CASB
- Once verified, SASE securely routes the traffic to on-prem, cloud, or SaaS applications
- The session remains continuously monitored for threats - enforces zero trust
