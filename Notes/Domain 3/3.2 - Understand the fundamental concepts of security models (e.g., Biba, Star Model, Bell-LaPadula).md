# Understand the fundamental concepts of security models 
- Security models are used to determine how security will be implemented and access rights will be designated for subjects and objects
- Properties of Security Models
	- Simple -> read rules
	- Star -> Write rules
	- Invocation -> calls to users
## Biba
- **Integrity** - focused
- Simple Integrity Policy - no read-down
- Star Integrity Policy - no write-up
- Invocation Property - prohibits lower-level subjects from invoking a subject at a higher level
## Bell-LaPadula
- **Confidentiality** - focused
- Simple Security Policy: No read-up
- Star Security Policy: No write-down
- DoD security model of choice
- Relies on the Discretionary Access Model
## Take Grant
- **Take** - subject *takes* rights over object
- **Grant** - subject *grants* rights to object
- **Create** - subject *creates* new rights
- **Remove** - subject *removes* own rights
## Brewer Nash
- **Confidentiality** - focused
- prevents conflict of interest
- "Chines Firewall"
## Clark Wilson
- **Memory Device**: 2 Bouncers at a bar name Clark and Wilson check IDs (constrained data items), don't worry about people in the bar (unconstrained data item), have a process to check IDs (Integrity Verification Procedure), allow people into the bar (Transformation Procedure)
- Uses security labels to grant access to objects
- Constrained Data Item (CDI) -> integrity is protected
	- unconstrained data item (UDI) -> not controlled by model
	- Integrity Verification Procedure (IVP): Scans data items and confirms integrity
	- Transformation Procedure (TP): only procedure allowed to modify a CDI
	- Access Control Triplet: relationship between
		- Authentication principal (user)
		- Programs (TP)
		- Data Item (UDI and CDI)
## Other Models
- **Trusted Computing Base:** combination of hardware, software, and controls that enforce security policy
	- should be as small as possible
	- creates trusted paths of communication
	- Security Perimeter: imaginary boundary that separates the TCB from the rest of the system
	- Reference Monitor -> access control
		- logical part of the TCB that confirms if a subject has right to uses. a resouce prior to access being granted
	- Security Kernel -> implements access control
		- Collection of TCB components that implement the reference monitor
- **State Machine Model**: a system that i always secure no matter the state
	- State: snapshot of a system -> all states must be evaluated
	- Secure State Machine: all state transitions result in another secure state
- **Information Flow Model**: focuses on the flow of information
	- based on a state machine model
	- used to detect covert channels
- **Non-Interference Model**: How actions of a high security subject affect the state or actions of a subject at a low security level
	- ensures actions don't interfere with other subjects or objects on the same system
- **Lattice Based Model**: defines security levels for objects and subjects
	- subjects: resources, computers, apps
	- objects: individuals, groups, organizations
- **dedicated**:
	- Data classification: single class (eg. top secret)
	- User Clearance: equal to or higher than the data classifcation
	- Need-to-Know: all users must have need to know for data
- **System High**:
	- Data classification: single class
	- User Clearance: equal to or higher than the data classification
	- Need-to-Know: need to know not required for all data - > can only access data authorized for
- **MultiLevel**:
	- Data classification: multiple classification models
	- User Clearance: different clearance levels -> system enforced access controls
	- Need-to-Know: enforced per user based on role and clearance
- **Compartmented**:
	- Data classification: single classification
	- User Clearance: equal to or higher than the data classification
	- Need-to-Know: explicit need to know for specific portions of data
