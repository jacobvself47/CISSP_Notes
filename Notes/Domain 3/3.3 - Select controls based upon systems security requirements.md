# Select controls based upon systems security requirements
## Common Criteria
- **Common Criteria (ISO-IEC 15048)**: Guidelines to evaluate products
	- Description of assets
	- Identification of threats
	- Analysis and rating of threats
	- Determination of Security Objectives
	- Select Security Requirements
	- Repeat
- Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Levels
	- **EAL 1** - Functionally Tested
	- **EAL 2** - Structurally Tested
	- **EAL 3** - Methodically tested and tracked
	- **EAL 4** - methodically designed and tested
	- **EAL 5** - semi-formally designed and tested 
	- **EAL 6** - semi-formally verified, designed, and tested
	- **EAL 7** - formally verified designed and tested
- **Mobile Devices and App Security**:
	- Devices: encryption, remote wiping (selective wiping), lockout, screen locks, application control
	- Application: Key management, credential management, authentication, geotagging, encryption, app whitelisting
- **Memory Types**:
	- ROM: Read-only memory -> from factory
	- RAM: readable and writable memory that contains information a computer uses during processing
		- Static RAM: uses flip-flops
		- Dynamic RAM: uses capacitors
	- PROM: programmable rom
		- EPROM: erasing, clearing
			- UVEPROM: Ultra-violet erase
			- EEPROM: Electric voltage erase
			- Flash memory: electronically erase or write
- **Storage Types**
	- Primary Storage: same as memory
	- Secondary Storage: magnetic, flash, optical
		- files read into primary memory before use by CPU
		- **Security concerns:**
			- Removal media can be used to steal data
			- Access controls and encryption must be applied
			- Data remains on the media
	- Random Access Storage: Devices can read at any point
	- Sequential Access Storage: Scan through all data before the desired location
