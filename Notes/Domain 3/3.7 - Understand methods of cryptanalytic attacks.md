# Understand methods of cryptanalytic attacks
## Brute force
- **Brute-Force**: every possible valid combination for a key or password
## Ciphertext only
- **Frequency analysis (ciphertext-only)**: counting the number of times each letter appears in the ciphertext
## Known plaintext
- **known plaintext**: attacker has a copy of the encrypted message and the plaintext message used to generate the ciphertext
## Frequency analysis
- **Frequency analysis (ciphertext-only)**: counting the number of times each letter appears in the ciphertext
## Chosen ciphertext
- **chosen plaintext**: picks the plaintexts that produce cyphertexts -> makes decryption easier
## Implementation attacks
- **implementation**: exploits weaknesses in the implementation of the cryptography system -> hardware or software
## Side-channel
- **side channel**: uses computer footprints from activity to retrieve information that is actively being encrypted
## Fault injection
- **Fault Injection**: causes an external fault
## Timing
- **Timing**: type of side-channel where the attacker measures precisely how long the operation takes to gain information about the processed data
## Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
- **man-in-the-middle**: attacker sits between two communicating parties and intercepts all communications
## Pass the hash
- **Pass the Hash** - steal a hashed password and reuse it to gain access
- Do not need to crack the password itself
- This is a problem with Windows NTLM Authentication - password hases are stored in memory and NTLM does not use a challenge-response mechanism for each session
## Kerberos exploitation
- Exploit the cryptographic weaknesses in ticket-based authentication
- Allows for attackers to forge Kerberos tickets
- The Key Distribution Center encrypts tickets using a shared secret (KRBTGT password hash)
- If the KRBTGT hash is compromised, they can forge authentication tickets and gain indefinite, persistent access -> Golden Ticket
- **golden ticket** - compromises the entire domain by forging the Ticket-granting Tickets
	- creates TGTs for any users and the TGT never expires
- **Silver ticket** - Exploit service account hashes to forge Ticket Granting Service tickets
	- dump NTLM hash of service account
	- use hash to forge TGS
	- Bypass Kerberos authentication without involving the DC
	- results in access to a single device
## Ransomware
- **Ransomware** - encrypts data asks for payment to decrypt
- No guarantee you will get the encryption keys to decrypt your data
- Best mitigation is to keep segregated backups

## Other Types of Attacks
 - **birthday**: collision attack or reverse hash matching - finds flaws in the one-to-one nature of a hashing function
- **replay**: attacker intercepts an encrypted message between two parties then later replays the captured message to open a new session
- **Rainbow table**: brute force attack that uses precomputed values for cryptographic hashes
- **meet-in-the-middle**: attacker uses a known plaintext to try every possible key pair to identify the correct key pair
