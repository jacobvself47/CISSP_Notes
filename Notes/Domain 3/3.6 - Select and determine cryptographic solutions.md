# Select and determine cryptographic solutions
- Cryptography provides the following key concepts
	- **confidentiality** - data remains private at rest, in transit and in use
	- **integrity** - data is not altered without authorization
	- **authentication** - verifies the claimed identity of system users
	- **nonrepudiation** - assurance to the recipient that the message was originated from the sender
- Other key concepts of cryptography
	- **Zero-Knowledge Proof** - prove knowledge of a fact to another user without revealing the fact itself
	- **Split Knowledge** - information or privilege is divided among multiple users - no single person has sufficient privileges to compromise the security of an environment
	- **Work Function (Work Factor)** - a way to measure the strength of a cryptography system by measuring the effort in terms of cost and/or time to decrypt the messages
		- usually measured against brute force
- Code vs. Cipher
	- **Code**: Cryptographic systems that operate on words or phrases
		- sometimes secret - not always confidential
	- **Ciphers**: alter or rearrange the characters or bits of a message to achieve confidentiality
- **Types of Ciphers**
	- Two ways to handle message:
		- **Stream Cipher**: Operate on one character or bit of a message at a time
		- **Block Cipher**: Operate on chunks of a message and apply the algorithm to an entire message block at the same time
	- Different approaches to ciphers:
		- **Transposition Ciphers**: rearrange the letters of a plaintext message to form a cipher text.
		- **Substitution Cipher:** replace each character or bit of the message with a different character
			- Cesar: a type of stream cipher that uses a key length of 1
			- Vignere: stream cipher with a long key (word or sentence)
			- One-time pad: steam cipher where the key length is the whole message - unbreakable
				- the one-time pad encryption key must be randomly generated and physically protected
		- **Initialization Vector**: uses a random bit string that is the same length as the block size and is XORed with the message
			- creates unique ciphertexts every time the same message is encrypted using the same key
- **XOR** - a binary operation that outputs true (1) if only one of the inputs is true (1), but false (0) if both inputs are the same.

| Input A | Input B | XOR Output |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 0       | 0       | 0          |
| 0       | 1       | 1          |
| 1       | 0       | 1          |
| 1       | 1       | 0          |
- **Confusion** - relationship between plaintext and the key is so complicated that analyzing new outputs will not reveal the key
- **Diffusion** - changes to plaintext result in multiple changes throughout the ciphertext
## Cryptographic life cycle (e.g., keys, algorithm selection)
- **Life cycle governance controls**
	- Specifying the cryptographic algorithm acceptable for use in an organization
	- Identifying the acceptable key lengths for use with each algorithm based on risk
	- Enumerating the secure transaction protocols that may be used
## Cryptographic methods 
### Symmetric
- **Overview**
	- Symmetric key algorithms rely on a "shared secret" encryption key that is distributed to all members who participate in communications
		- The key is used by all parties to both encrypt and decrypt messages
		- Pros:
			- Generally faster
		- Cons:
			- Not scalable
			- Not good for key distribution
			- Not good for non-repudiation
- **Calculation**
	- N(N-1)/2
	- N = the number of people in the environment
- **Block Cipher Modes of Operation**
	- **Electronic Codebook (ECB)** mode: simple; not secure
		- processes 64 bit blocks with a key
		- repeat 64 bit blocks are encrypted identically
		- leads to easy cracking
	- **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)** mode: errors propagate
		- each block of unencrypted text is XORed with the block of ciphertext immediately preceding it before it is encrypted
		- implements initialization vector and XORs it with the first block of the message
		- produces a unique output every time
	- **Cipher Feedback (CFB)** mode: CBC but on memory buffers
		- operates against data produced in real time
		- uses memory buffers of the same block size
		- as buffer becomes full, it is encrypted and sent to the recipients
		- uses IV and chaining
	- **Output Feedback (OFB)** mode: XOR plaintext with a seed value
		- For the first encrypted block, and IV is used to create the seed value
		- future seed values are derived by running the algorithm on the previous seed value
		- advantages: no chaining function; errors do not propagate
	- **Counter (CTR)** mode: suited well for parallel computing
		- uses a stream cipher similar to CFB and OFB
		- instead of creating a seed value for each operation from the previous value, it uses a simple counter that increments for each operation
		- errors do not propagate
		- can be implemented in parallel
	- **Galois/Counter mode (GCM)**: CTR + Data Authenticity
		- provides the recipient assurances of the integrity of the data received
		- adds authentication tags to the encryption process
	- **Counter with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Mode**
		- confidentiality mode with data authenticity
- **Data Encryption Standard (DES) and 3DES**
	- Regular DES is no longer secure
	- 3DES recently no longer secure - involves running the algorithm 3 times

### Asymmetric
- **Overview**
	- Uses Public and Private key pairs to encrypt data
	- **Public Key**: shared amongst communicating parties
	- **Private Key**: Secret key
	- Data Considerations
		- encrypt messages with the recipient's public key
		- decrypt message with your own private key
	- Digital Signature Considerations
		- Sign message with private key -> non-repudiation
		- Validate the signature with the sender's public key
	- Asymmetric cryptography is more secure than symmetric
	- supports scalability, key distribution, and non-repudiation
- **Calculation**
	- N x 2
	- double the number of people in the question

		- check to ensure the certificate was not revoked using:
			- Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
			- Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
