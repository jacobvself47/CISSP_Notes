# Apply security principles to site and facility design
- **Secure Facility plan**: outlines the organization's security needs and emphasizes methods or mechanisms to employ to provide security
	- developed through risk assessment and critical path analysis
		- **critical path analysis**: identification of relationships between mission-critical applications, processes, and operations and all the necessary supporting elements (physical and technological) -> identifies interdependencies
		- **technology convergence**: the tendency for various technologies, solutions, utilities, and systems to evolve and merge over time. -> Multiple systems performing redundant tasks
	- security mechanisms are positioned to operate in series rather than in parallel
- **Site Selection**: security should take precedence
	- Visibility, the composition of the area, accessibility, and the effects of natural disasters
- **Facility Design**: The top priority is the protection of the life and safety of personnel
	- Common health and safety regulations:
		- OSHA: occupational safety and health administration
		- EPA: Environmental Protection Agency
- **Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED):**
	- design of the physical environment can be managed to create behavioral effects or changes in people present that result in the reduction of crime
	- first-generation -> physical considerations
		- four principles:
			- access control: subtly guide physical access
			- natural surveillance: make criminals feel uneasy through increased opportunities for them to be observed
			- image and milieu:
				- image: visual elements of an environment
				- milieu: broader environment/setting
			- territorial control: attempt to make an area feel like an inclusive, caring community
	- second-generation -> social/community-focused
		- Four principles
			- social cohesion: connectedness within a community
			- community culture: considering the values, traditions, and norms that shape the community
			- connectivity: physical and social links within a community
			- threshold capacity: ability to absorb and respond to external influences
- **Implement Site and Facility Security Controls**
	- **Administrative physical security controls**: facility construction and selection, site management, design, personnel controls, emergency response
	- **Technical physical security controls**: building access controls, intrusion detections, alarms, cameras, monitoring
	- **Physical controls of physical security**: fencing, lighting, locks, person traps, dogs, guards
		- **Fence**:
			- 3-4 feet - deters casual trespassers
			- 6-7 feet - too hard to climb easily
			- 8 feet (w/ barbed wire) - deters intruders
		- **Temperature**:
			- Humidity: 20% - 80% ideal
				- more than 60% can cause corrosion
				- too little creates static electricity
			- Temps: 
				- Computers between 60-75 degrees - damage at 175 degrees
				- Storage devices damaged at 100 degrees
		- **Electrical Impacts**
			- **Blackout**: prolonged loss of power
			- **Brownout**: prolonged low voltage
			- **Fault**: short loss of power
			- **Surge**: prolonged high voltage
			- **Spike**: temporary high-voltage
			- **Sag**: temporary low-voltage
			- **Voltage and Noise**
				- **Electromagnetic Interference**
					- **Common mode noise** - difference in power between the hot and ground wires
					- **Traverse mode noise** - difference between hot and neutral wires
				- **Radio Frequency Interference** - generated by electrical appliances, light source, electrical cables, and circuits
				- 40 volts = destruction of sensitive circuits
				- 1000 volts = scrambling of monitor displays
				- 1500 volts = destruction of hard drive data
				- 2000 = abrupt system shutdown
				- 4000 = printer jam or component damage
				- 17000 = permanent circuit damage
			- UPS - self-charging battery that can be used to supply consistent, clean power
		- **Lights**: 8 feet high with 2 feet candle power
		- **Lock Types**
			- Electronic Combo Locks (cipher) - something you know
			- Key Card Systems - something you have
			- Biometric Systems - something you are
			- Conventional Locks - easily picked
			- Pick and Bump Resistant locks
		- **Notes on cheap physical security controls**
			- Lighting is the most commonly deployed outdoor physical security mechanism
				- it is a mild deterrent
			- Key locks are the most commonly deployed indoor/outdoor physical security mechanism
				- also key locks are very cheap
	- **Threats to Physical Access Controls**
		- A security guard or other monitoring system must be deployed to prevent:
			- Abuses of physical access control -> propping open doors
			- Masquerading is using someone else's security ID to gain access
			- Piggybacking is following someone through a doorway
	- **Visitors**
		- escorts, badges, tracking actions
	- **Audit Trail and Access Logs**
		- creation - may be created manually - can be automated
		- monitor - cctv
		- used in the reconstruction of events
- **functional order for controls**
	- 1. Deter -> boundary restrictions
	- 2. Deny -> locked vaults
	- 3. Detect -> motion sensors
	- 4. Delay -> cable lock on the asset
	- 5. Determine -> assess the situation to understand what is occurring
	- 6. Decide -> response to implement
- Centralized server or computer rooms need not be human compatible 
- Intrusion Alarms
	- **Deterrent alarms** - engage additional locks, shut doors, lock dars
		- aims to make further intrusion more difficult
	- **Repellent alarms** - trigger sirens, bells, or turn lights on
		- discourage intruders
	- **Notification alarms** - silent notifications to appropriate personnel
	- **local alarm system** - broadcast alarm signal that can be heard from a distance
	- **central station system** - silent locally, but alerts off-site monitoring
	- **auxiliary alarm systems** - notify emergency services
