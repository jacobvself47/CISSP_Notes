# Design site and facility security controls
## Wiring closets/intermediate distribution facilities
- **Wire Closet**
	- Physical security is most important
	- **cable plant management policy** - physical structure and deployment of network cabling and related devices
		- **entrance facility** - demarcation point or main distribution frame where building cable connects to the provider cables
		- **equipment room** - main wiring closet for the building, often connected to or adjacent to the entrance facility
		- **backbone distribution system** - wired connections between the equipment and telecommunications rooms
		- **Wiring Closet** - This serves the connection needs of a large building's floor or section - interconnection point between the backbone and horizontal distribution systems
		- **Horizontal distribution system** - connects the telecommunications room and work areas, often including cabling, cross-connection blocks, patch panels, and supporting hardware infrastructure
## Server rooms/data centers
- Server rooms, data centers, server vaults - enclosed, restricted and protected rooms
- location of the mission-critical hardware and network devices
- Not optimized for workers
- Walls should have a one-hour minimum fire rating
- Server rooms should be located at the core of the building
- Controlling access:
	- **smartcards** - general term for accessing security locations
	- **magnetic stripe cards** - machine-readable ID cards with a magnetic stripe
		- easy to duplicate, not sufficient for authentication to secure locations
		- implement in conjunction with a PIN
	- **badge** - identification or authentication
		- identification - user must provide an authentication factor
		- authorization - user must provide identification information
	- **proximity device** - general term for devices that control access to secure locations
	- **passive proximity device** - no active electronics
		- magnet that alters the electromagnetic field generated by the reader
	- **field-powered proximity device** - electronic device
		- powered by the electromagnetic field 
		- RFID device
	- **transponder proximity device** - self-powered and transmits a signal to the reader
## Media storage facilities
- Reusable removable media should have data removed and not retained
- implement a media librarian or custodian to check-in/checkout media
- Use sanitization tools on the returned media
## Evidence storage
- **Evidence Storage** - logs, drive images, VM snapshots
	- locked cabinets
	- isolated storage facilities
	- offline storage
	- access restrictions and logging
	- hash management and encryption
## Restricted and work area security
- limit access to restricted areas
- implement walls, partitions, and different work areas to prevent shoulder surfing
- implement a clean desk policy to limit sensitive information from being easily accessible
- **SCIF** - sensitve compartment information facility
	- used by government agencies to provide a secure environment for highly senstive data storage and computation
## Utilities and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
- See 3.9
## Environmental issues (e.g., natural disasters, man-made)
## Fire prevention, detection, and suppression
 - **Fire & Suppression Agents**
	- Class A (ASH) - wood, paper, etc - distinguished with water or soda acid
	- Class B (BOIL) - burning alcohol, oil, or petroleum - distinguished with gas or soda acid
	- Class C (Conductive) - electrical fires - distinguished with a non-conductive agent like a type of gas
	- Class D (Dilythium) - burning metals - distinguished with dry powder
	- Class K (Kitchen fires) - burning oils or grease - distinguished with wet chemicals
	- Three categories of **fire detection**
		- smoke sensing
		- flame sensing 
		- heat sensing
	- **damage from fire suppression**
		- smoke is damage to storage devices
		- heat can damage any electronic component
		- short circuits
- **Water Suppression**
	- Preaction Systems - closed sprinkler heads with a heat/smoke detector
		- good for areas with people and computers
	- Wet pipe systems - filled with water
	- Dry pipe systems - closed sprinkler heads, filled with compressed air, water is held back by a valve
		- good for areas that freeze
	- Deluge Systems - water is held back by a deluge valve
- **Gas Discharge** - bad for people
	- remove oxygen from system
	- Halon is effective but bad for the environment
## Power (e.g., redundant, backup)
- **surge protectors** - first level of power management
	- protects against power overloads - spikes
	- do not use if loss of power will damage the equipment
- **Power conditioner** - advanced surge protector - filters line noise
- **UPS - Uninterruptible Power Supply** - self-charging battery
	- used to supply consistent, clean power
	- offers surge protection, power conditioning
	- **double conversion** - takes power in from outlet, stores it in a battery, pulls power from battery
	- **line interactive** - surge protector, battery charger, voltage regulator
		- used to switch power when there is a power failure
- **Generators** - supply power to an entire building rather than a few devices
	- protects against brownouts and blackouts
	- still need to install a UPS
