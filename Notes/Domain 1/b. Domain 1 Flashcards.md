- Risk Management
	- Asset: 
		- anything used in a business process or task
	- Threat: 
		- Any potential occurrence that may cause and undesirable or unwanted outcome for a specific asset
	- Threat Agent: 
		- People, program, hardware, or system that intentionally exploit vulnerabilities
	- Threat Vector: 
		- path or means by which an attack or threat agent can gain access to a target
	- Vulnerability: 
		- weakness in an asset or the abscense/weakness of a safeguard/countermeasures
	- Risk: 
		- possibility or likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability to cause harm to an asset
	- Safeguards: 
		- safeguard, security control, protection mechanism, or countermeasure is anything that removes or reduces a vulnerability or protects against threats
	- NIST 800-37 Process

	- Residual Risk (definition)
		- Risk that remains even with safeguards -> Accept rather than mitigate
	- Inherent Risk
		- Risk that exists in the absence of controls
	- Total Risk
		- Risk present if no safeguards were implemented across the whole organization
	- Risk Calculation
		- Risk = Threat * Vulnerability
	- Exposure Factor
		- percentage of loss if a specific asset were violated by a realized risk
	- Single Loss Expectancy (definition)
		- % cost associate with a single realized risk against a specific asset
	- Single Loss Expectancy (calculation)
		- Asset Value * Exposure Factor
	- Annualized Rate of Occurrence
		- Frequency with a specific threat or risk will occur in a single year
	- Annualized Loss Expectancy (definition)
		- yearly cost of all instances of a specific realized threat against a specific asset
	- Annualized Loss Expectancy (calculation)
		- ALE = Single Loss Expectancy * Annualized Rate of Occurrence
	- Value of Safeguard
		- Value of Safeguard = ALE before Safeguard - ALE after Safeguard - Annual Cost of Safeguard
	- Controls Gap (Definition)
		- Amount of risk reduced by implementing safeguard
	- Residual Risk (Definition)
		- Residual Risk = Total Risk - Controls Gap
	- Qualitative Analysis
		- Subjective scoring system to rank threats and countermeasures relative to the system or environment
	- Delphi Technique
		- Qualitative risk analysis that uses anonymous feedback
	- Quantitative Analysis Process
		- Inventory assets and assign values -> (AV)
		- Identify Threats for each asset -> (EF) (SLE)
		- Perform threat analysis -> (ARO)
		- Estimate annualized lose expectancy -> (ALE)
		- Research counter measures for each threat -> (ARO) (ALE)
		- Perform cost/benefit analysis of countermeasures
	- Loss Potential
		- What would be lost if the threat agent was successful
	- Delayed Loss
		- Loss that could occur over time
- Security Controls
	- Safeguards
		- a control, technology, policy, or action that is proactively implemented to protect an asset and reduce the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
	- Countermeasures
		- Any action, technology, or control that responds to a threat or incident to mitigate or reduce its impact 
	- Category of Controls
		- Technical - Hardware and software
		- Administrative - policies and procedures
		- Physical - physically touch
	- Types of Controls
		- Deterrent - discourage violation
		- Preventative - stop activity from occurring
		- Detective - discover after the fact
		- Compensating - support other controls
		- Corrective - modify the environment back to a steady state
