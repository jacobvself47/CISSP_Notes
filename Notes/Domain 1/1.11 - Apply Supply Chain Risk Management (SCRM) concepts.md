# Apply Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) concepts
- SCRM - means to ensure that all of the vendors or links in the supply chain are reliable trustworthy, reputable organizations that disclose their practices and security requirements to their business partners
## Risks associated with the acquisition of products and services from suppliers and providers
- product tampering
- counterfeits
- implants
## Risk mitigations 
- **third-party assessment and monitoring**
	- monitor each link in the supply chain
	- each link should have security operations that align with the use of the final product
- minimum security requirements
- **service level requirements**
	- definition of the security requirements for the new asset
	- SLRs are often defined before the establishment of the SLA
- **silicon root of trust (hardware root of trust)**
	- foundational and tamper-resistant component within a computer's hardware
	- provides a secure starting point for establishing trust and security in a system
	- ensure integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of the system's boot process
	- Key points of a silicon root of trust
		- Tamper-resistant
		- Secure boot - verifies the integrity of the firmware, bootloader, and OS during the boot sequence
		- Cryptographic Operations - digital signatures, encryption, and decryption
		- Remote Attestation - enables a remote entity to verify the system
- **physically unclonable function**
	- specialized electronic component that generates a unique, unpredictable digital identifier
	- Used to provide hardware-based security features for device authentication, encryption keys, or other things
- **software bill of materials**
	- structured and comprehensive inventory of all software components and dependencies that make up a software application
	- Enhances transparency, security, compliance, and management
	- Provide vulnerability information
