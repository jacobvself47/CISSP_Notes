	- Usually involves an outside investigator or auditor
	- Provide security oversight to third parties relied on by the organization
	- Verify compliance with the stated security objectives
		- On-site assessment - Visit the site to interview personnel and observe their operating habits

		- Process/Policy Review - Request copies of their security policies
		- Third-Party Audit - Independent auditor review
## Alignment of the security function to business strategy, goals, mission, and objectives
- Design and implement security based on business cases, budget restrictions, or scarcity or resources
- Top-down approach - senior management is responsible for initiating and defining policies for the organization
- Security Policies - direction for all levels of the organization's hierarchy

			- Based on the strategic and tactical plan
			- Frequent updates
			- Include resource allotments, budget requirements, staffing plans, and implementation procedures

		- Define an SLR (service-level requirement) - statement of the expectations of service and performace
		- Finally define an SLA - formal agreement between two companies
		- ISA - interconnection security agreement
			- formal declaration of security, risks, and requirements
