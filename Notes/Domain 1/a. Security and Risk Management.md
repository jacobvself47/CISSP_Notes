## Areas for Review
**Types of Security Plans**
- **Strategic Plan**: stable, defines security purpose
- **Tactical Plan**: Midterm plan, details on how to accomplish goals
- **Operational Plan**: short-term, highly detailed plan
**Due Diligence vs. Due Care**
- **Due diligence:** the process of investigating, analyzing and assessing risks before making decisions or taking action
	- Identify risks and ensure informed decision making
- **Due Care**: The actions taken to implement and maintain safeguards to mitigate risks identified
	- ensure that risks are managed and that the organization takes appropriate protective measures
- Due Care Identifies risks, Due Care acts to address those risks
**Policies, Standards, Procedures, Guideline**
- **Policy**: defines scope of security needed and discusses assets.
- **Standard**: compulsory requirements for the homogenous use of IT
- **Procedure**: detailed, step-by-step guide on the exact actions to implement security
- **Guideline**: Recommendations on how security requirements are implemented
Threat-Modeling Frameworks
- **PASTA**: risk-centric approach
- **VAST**: Agile methodology
- **DREAD**: Threat rating system, based on five questions
- **STRIDE**: Threat categorization scheme


### Missed questions
- Security governance seeks to compare the security process and infrastructure used within the organization with knowledge and insight obtained from external sources
- **COBIT Framework**:
	- Provide stakeholder value
	- Holistic Approach
	- Dynamic Governance System
	- Governance Distinct from Management
	- Tailored to Enterprise Needs
	- End-to-End Governance System
- **Authorization to Operate (ATO)**
- **Reduction Analysis**: decomposing the system after threat modeling to gain a greater understanding of the logic of the system
	- Trust Boundaries
	- Dataflow paths
	- Input points
	- privileged operations
	- details about security stance and approach
- **Risk Maturity Model (RMM)**: assess the key indicators and activities of a mature, sustainable, and repeatable risk management process
	- ad hoc - chaotic starting point
	- preliminary - disjointed risk assessment process
	- defined - standardized risk framework adopted org-wide
	- integrated - risk management operations are integrated into business process, risk is considered in business decisions
	- optimized - focused on achieving objectives
- **Risk Management Framework (NIST 800-37)**
	- Prepare to execute the RMF
	- Categorize the system and the information based on the impact of loss
	- Select security controls
	- Implement security controls
	- Assess the controls to determine if the controls are implemented correctly
	- Authorize the system or controls based on a determination that the risk is acceptable post implementation
	- Monitor the system and control s on an ongoing basis
- **Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)**: longest period a business function can be unavailable before causing irreparable harm to the business.
- GDPR outlines standard contractual clauses that may be used to facilitate data transfer from EU to US
- U.S. patent law provides for an exclusivity period of 20 years beginning at the time a utility patent application is submitted to the Patent and Trademark Office.
- Copyright protection generally lasts for 70 years after the death of the last surviving author of the work.
