		- resource requirements - $ to create and maintain plan
		- external dependencies - vendors, legal, regulatory
	- **business impact analysis**
		- identifying priorities - critical business functions listed in order of importance
			- Asset Value, MTD/MTO,  RTO<MTD, RPO
		- Risk identification - natural and man-made
		- Likelihood assessment - determine ARO for each threat
		- Impact analysis - analyze data and determine impact on business operations
		- resource prioritization - allocate resources based on BIA risk ranking
	- **continuity planning** - outcome is a continuity of operations plan (COOP)
		- strategy development - determine risks and the level of resources required for mitigation
		- provisions and processes - design specific procedures and mechanisms to mitigate selected risks
	- **plan approval and implementation**
		- plan approval - top-level executive, if possible
		- implementation, training, education
		- documentation
- **Key Acronyms**
	- **MTD** - Maximum Tolerable Downtime
		- The maximum length of time a business function can be inoperable without causing irreparable harm to the business
	- **MTO** - Maximum Tolerable Outage
		- Interchangeable term with MTD
	- **RTO** - Recovery Time Objective
		- The amount of time in which you think you can feasibly recover a function in the event of a disruption
	- **RPO** - Recovery Point Objective
		- Measurement of how much loss (data) can be accepted by the organization when a disaster occurs
	- **WRT** - work time recovery
		- Time to verify the system or data integrity after 
- Ensure that RTOs are less than MTDs
	- A system should never be unavailable beyond the maximum tolerable downtime

## Business impact analysis (BIA)
- Stages of a BIA

	- Risk Identification
		- Natural threats
		- Person-centric threats
