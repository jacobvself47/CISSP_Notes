# 1.10 - Understand and apply threat modeling concepts and methodologies
- Approaches to threat modeling:
	- **Asset Focus**: uses asset valuation results to identify threats to valuable assets
	- **Attack Focus**: Identify attackers and threats based on attackers goals
	- **Software Focus**: Threats against software developed by the organization
- **STRIDE** - threat focused
	- Spoofing: falsified identity
	- Tampering: unauthorized changes of data
	- Repudiation: Deny having performed action
	- Information Disclosure
	- Denial of Service: prevent authorized access
	- Elevation of Privilege
- **PASTA**: Focus on developing counter measures based on asset value
	- 1. Definition of the Objective
	- 2. Definition of the Technical Scope
	- 3. Application Decomposition and Analysis
	- 4. Threat Analysis
	- 5. Weakness and Vulnerability Analysis
	- 6. Attack Modeling and Simulation
	- 7. Risk Analysis and Management
- **VAST**: Threat Modeling as part of the Agile programming methodology
	- Visual
	- Agile
	- Simple
	- Threat
- **DREAD**: rating system based on answers to five main questions about each threat
	- Damage - how sever is the damage
	- Reproducibility - how complicated is it exploit
	- Exploitability - How hard is it to perform the attack
	- Affected Users - How many users will be affected (percentage)
	- Discoverability - How hard is it to find the weakness
- **Reduction Analysis**: decomposing the system after threat modeling to gain a greater understanding of the logic of the system
	- Trust Boundaries
	- Dataflow paths
	- Input points
	- privileged operations
	- details about security stance and approach
