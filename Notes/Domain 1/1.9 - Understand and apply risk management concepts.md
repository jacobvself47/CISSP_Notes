# 1.9 - Understand and apply risk management concepts
- Key Points about Risk
	- Not every risk can be mitigated
	- Management's Job to decide how risk is handled
	- Human safety is most important
	- Legal issues? Call and attorney
- Key Risk Definitions
	- **Asset**: anything used in a business process or task
	- **Threat**: Any potential occurrence that may cause and undesirable or unwanted outcome for a specific asset
	- **Threat Agent**: People, programs, hardware, or systems that intentionally exploit vulnerabilities
	- **Threat Vector**: path or means by which an attack or threat agent can gain access to a target
	- **Vulnerability**: weakness in an asset or the absence/weakness of a safeguard/countermeasures
	- **Risk**: possibility or likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability to cause harm to an asset
	- **Safeguards**: A safeguard, security control, protection mechanism, or countermeasure is anything that removes or reduces a vulnerability or protects against threats 
## Threat and vulnerability identification
- Creating an exhaustive list of all possible threats to the identified assets
- Include threat agents and threat events
- 
## Risk analysis, assessment, and scope
### Types of Risk
- **Residual**: Risk that remains even with Safeguards
	- Accept rather than mitigate
- **Inherent**: Risk that exists in absence of controls
- **Total**: Risk present if no safeguards were implement across the whole organization
### Risk Calculation
- **Risk**
```
Risk = Threat * Vulnerability
```
- **Exposure Factor (EF)**: % of loss if a *specific asset* were violated by a *realized risk* 
- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**: $ cost associated with a *single realized risk* against a *specific asset* #Calculation 
```
SLE = AssetValue(AV) * ExposureFactor(EF) 
```
- **Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**: Frequency with which a specific threat or risk will occur in a single year.
- **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)**: Yearly cost of all instances of a specific realized threat against a specific asset.
```
ALE = SingleLossExpectancy (SLE) AnnualizedRateofOccurence (ARO) 
```
- **Value of a Safeguard**
```
ValueOfSafeguard = (ALE) before Safeguard - (ALE) after Safeguard - Annual Cost Of Safeguard 
```
- **Controls Gap**: Amount of risk reduced by implementing safeguards
```
Total Risk - Controls Gap = Residual Risk
```
### Risk Analysis
- **Qualitative**: Scoring system to rank threats and countermeasures relative to system or environment
	- Subjective analysis
	- Delphi Technique - uses anonymous feedback
- **Quantitative**
	- Inventory assets and assign values -> (AV)
	- Identify Threats for each asset -> (EF) (SLE)
	- Perform threat analysis -> (ARO)
	- Estimate annualized loss expectancy -> (ALE)
	- Research countermeasures for each threat -> (ARO) (ALE)
	- Perform cost/benefit analysis of countermeasures
- **Loss Potential:** What would be lost if the threat agent was successful
- **Delayed loss:** loss that could occur over time
	- example: Firewall goes down -> customers can't reach your e-commerce site
### Risk Analysis Methods
- **Quantitative Risk Analysis**
	- Identifying a dollar figure on each asset and threat impact
	- It is not sufficient because not all elements and aspects of the analysis can be accurately quantified because some are qualitative, subjective, or intangible
	- **Phases of Quantitative Risk Analysis**
		- Inventory assets and assign a value (Asset Value - AV)
		- Research each asset and produce a list of all possible threats to each asset - results in asset-threat pairing
		- For each asset-threat pairing, calculate the exposure factor (EF)
		- Calculate the single loss expectancy (SLE) for each asset-threat pairing
		- Perform a threat analysis to calculate the likelihood of the threat being realized within a single year (Annualized Rate of Occurrence - ARO)
		- Derive the overall loss potential per threat by calculating the annualized loss expectancy (ALE)
		- Research countermeasures for each threat and then calculate the changes to ARO, EF, and ALE based on an applied countermeasure
		- Perform a cost/benefit analysis for each countermeasure and select the most appropriate response to each threat
- **Qualitative Risk Analysis**
	- Scenario, perception, or gut reaction-based analysis
	- Rank threats on a relative scale to evaluate their risks, costs, and effects
	- Techniques for Qualitative Risk Analysis
		- Delphi Technique - anonymous feedback-and-response process
			- elicit honest and uninfluenced responses from all participants
## Risk response and treatment
- Risk Responses and Treatments
	- **Mitigation or Reduction**
		- implementation of safeguards, security controls, and countermeasures to reduce and/or eliminate vulnerabilities
		- Elimination of a risk can sometimes be achieved, but typically, some risk remains after mitigation efforts
	- **Assignment or Transfer**
		- placement of the responsibility of loss due to a risk onto another entity or organization
		- The most common example is purchasing insurance
	- **Deterrence**
		- Implementing deterrents to would-be violators of security and policy
		- Examples include auditing, security cameras, security guards
	- **Avoidance**
		- selecting alternate options or activities that have less associated risk than the current option
		- Example: conducting business in Arizona over Florida to avoid the risk related to hurricanes
	- **Acceptance**
		- Choose this risk treatment when the results of a cost/benefit analysis show countermeasure costs would outweigh the possible cost of loss due to a risk
		- Management has accepted the consequences and loss if the risk is realized
		- Risk Acceptance should be documented and periodically reviewed
	- **Reject or Ignore**
		- This is not an acceptable response to risk
		- Could be considered negligent in court
- Organization Risk Terminology
	- **Risk Appetite** - the total amount of risk that an organization is willing to shoulder in aggregate across all assets
	- **Risk Capacity** - the level of risk an organization is able to shoulder
	- **Risk Tolerance** - the amount or level of risk that an organization will accept per individual asset-threat pair
	- **Risk Limit** - the maximum level or risk above the risk target that will be tolerated before further risk management actions are taken
## Applicable types of controls 
 - Countermeasure Selection and Implementation
	 - Relies heavily on the cost/benefit analysis results
		 - A good countermeasure will have the following characteristics
			 - Cost is less than Asset Value
			 - Cost should be less than the value of the countermeasure
			 - Make the attack more difficult
			 - Provide a solution to an identified problem
			 - Testable and verifiable
			 - Consistent and uniform protection
 - Categories of security mechanisms
	 - **Administrative** - policies and procedures defined
		 - Management or procedural controls
		 - Focus on personnel oversight and business practices
		 - Examples: policies, procedures, background checks, data classification, security awareness training
	 - **Technical/Logical** - hardware or software mechanisms that manage access or provide protection for the resource/system
		 - Examples: authentication methods, encryption, access control lists, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems
	 - **Physical** - provide protection to the facility
		 - Examples: security guards, fences, motion detectors, badges, swipe cards, alarms
 - Types of Controls
	 - **Preventive** - thwart or stop unwanted activity
		 - Examples: fences, authentication, access control vestibules, alarm systems, separation of duties, DLP, penetration testing, encryption, auditing, training, firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems
	 - **Detective** - Discover unwanted activity
		 - Operate after the fact and only discover activity after it has occurred
		 - Examples: Motion detectors, security cameras, audit trails, Intrusion Detection Systems
	 - **Corrective** - modifies the environment to return systems to normal after unwanted activity
		 - Examples: Quarantining malicious software through Intrusion Prevention Systems, springs on a door, etc.
	 - **Recovery** - Extension of corrective controls, but have or advanced abilities
		 - Repair or restore resources, functions, and capabilities after a security violation has occurred
		 - Usually related to security violations
		 - Examples: Backups, Fault-tolerant drive systems, system imaging, server clustering, antimalware software
	 - **Deterrent** - discourage security policy violations
		 - Rely on individuals being convinced not to take an unwanted action
		 - Examples: security-awareness training, locks, fences, badges, cameras
	 - **Directive** - direct, confine, or control the actions of subjects to force or encourage compliance
		 - Examples: security policy criteria, posted notifications, monitoring, supervisors
	 - **Compensating** - provide options to existing controls to aid in the enforcement
		 - Used in addition to or in place of another control
		 - improve the effectiveness of a primary control
## Control assessments 
- Formal evaluation of a security infrastructure's individual mechanisms against a baseline or expectation
- Goals of Control Assessment:
	- ensure the effectiveness of the security mechanism
	- evaluate the quality and thoroughness of the risk management process
	- produce a report on the strengths and weaknesses of the security infrastructure
## Continuous monitoring and measurement
- Monitoring and Measurement of security controls ensures that the quantified benefits of the control are meeting expectations
## Reporting 
- Risk reporting involves the production of a risk report and a presentation of the report to interested/relevant parties
- Internal Reporting:
	- intended for internal stakeholders, executives, management, employees and relevant departments
	- support informed decision-making and risk management 
	- Detailed information on the assessment, exposure, control measures, and effectiveness of the overall risk management process
	- Key Types of Internal Reports
		- Risk Registers (risk log)
			- Identified risks
			- Evaluation of the severity and prioritization of risks
			- Risk responses
			- Tracking of risk mitigation process
		- Risk Heat Maps (Risk Matrix)
			- Grid-based document that shows qualitative risk analysis
		- Key Risk Indicators
			- provide an early signal of increasing risk - forward-looking
## Continuous improvement
- Risk Analysis is a point-in-time metric
- Security landscape is constantly changing
- Continuous improvement is required to effectively manage risks
- Risk Maturity Model (RMM) - assess the activities of the risk management process
	- **Ad-hoc** - starting point to initiate risk management
	- **Preliminary** - disorganized risk management
	- **Defined** - standardized risk framework across the organization
	- **Integrated** - Risk management is integrated into the business processes, and metrics are used to gather data on the effectiveness of risk management
	- **Optimized** - Focuses on achieving objectives instead of reactionary risk management
