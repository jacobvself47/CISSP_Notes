# Understand and apply security concepts
## Confidentiality, integrity, and availability, authenticity, and nonrepudiation 
- **CIA Triad** - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
- **5 Pillars of Information Security** - Confidentiality, integrity,  availability, authenticity, and nonrepudiation
### Confidentiality
- **Confidentiality** - The protection of the secrecy of data, objects, or resources
- **Goal** - prevent or minimize unauthorized access to data
- **Applicable Countermeasures** - encryption, network traffic padding, access control, authentication procedures, data classification, and training
- **Related Concepts**
	- Sensitivity - the quality of information that could cause harm or damage if disclosed
	- Discretion - control the disclosure of information to minimize harm or damage
	- Criticality - the level to which information is mission-critical
	- Concealment - hiding or preventing disclosure
	- Secrecy - keeping something a secret to prevent disclosure
	- Privacy - keeping information confidential
	- Seclusion - storing something out of the way
	- Isolation - keeping information separated from others
### Integrity
- **Integrity** - protecting the reliability and correctness of data
- **Goal** - prevent unauthorized alterations of data
- **Applicable Countermeasures** - access control, authentication procedures, intrusion detection systems, encryption, hash verifications
- **Related Concepts**
	- Accuracy - being correct and precise
	- Truthfulness - being a reflection of reality
	- Validity - factually or logically sound
	- Accountability - responsible for actions and results
	- Responsibility - having control over something or someone
	- Completeness - having all the necessary parts
	- Comprehensiveness - complete in scope
### Availability
- **Availability** - authorized subjects are granted timely and uninterrupted access to objects
- **Goal** - ensure authorized access and an acceptable level of performance to quickly handle interruptions, provide redundancy and backups, and prevent data loss or destruction
- **Applicable Countermeasures** - access controls, performance monitoring, firewalls and routers, redundancy, backup verifications, business continuity planning and testing
- **Related Concepts**
	- Usability - easy to use or learn
	- Accessibility - wide range of subjects can interact with a resource
	- Timeliness - prompt, on time, low-latency
### Authenticity
- **Authenticity** - data is authentic or genuine and originates from its alleged source
- Verifying that data came from its claimed source
### Nonrepudiation
- **Nonrepudiation** - ensures that the subject of an activity cannot deny that the activity occurred.
- Made possible through identification, authentication, authorization, auditing, and accounting
- Digital Certificates, session identifiers, transaction logs

### Other Concepts
- **DAD Triad** - Disclosure, alteration, and destruction
	- Represents the failures of security protection of the CIA triad
- **AAA Services** - Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
	- Identification - claiming to be an identity when attempting to access a secured system
	- Authentication - proving that you are the identity you are claiming
	- Authorization - permissions of a resource and object access for a specific identity
	- Auditing - Recording a log of the events related to the system and subjects
	- Accounting - Accountability - reviewing logs
